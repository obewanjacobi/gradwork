\begin{problem}{10}
The Florida Juice Company makes two types of fruit punch – Fruity and Tangy – by blending orange juice and apple juice into a mixture. The fruit punch is sold in 5-gallon bottles. A bottle of Fruity earns a profit of \$3, and a bottle of Tangy earns a \$2 profit. A bottle of Fruity requires 3 gallons of orange juice and 2 gallons of apple juice, while a bottle of Tangy requires 4 gallons of orange juice and 1 gallon of apple juice. There are 200 gallons of apple juice and 120 gallons of orange juice available.
