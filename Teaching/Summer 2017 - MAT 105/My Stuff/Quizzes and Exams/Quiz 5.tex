\begin{problem}{25}
A squad of nerds took a vote of which gaming console is best out of 3 (Xbox wasn't included because it's stupid). Given the chart below with the given number of votes, who wins the plurality method? Who wins using the Borda count? Who wins the method of pairwise comparison? Are there any violations here to be considered?

\begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}||p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|  }
 \hline
 \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Votes} \\
 \hline
 Number of Voters &8&9&2\\
 \hline
 First   &    PC      &PS4    &  Switch\\
 Second&  PS4    & PC      &  PC\\
 Third &    Switch &Switch&  PS4\\
