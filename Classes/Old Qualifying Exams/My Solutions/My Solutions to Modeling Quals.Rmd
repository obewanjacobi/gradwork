#Prelude
This document is written in reference to qualifying exams given at the University of Louisville in past years. These solutions are not given from the University, but of my work alone as a way to study for my own qualifying exam. If any tips or recommendations come up and you feel you should share, feel free to raise an issue on GitHub where I have this document saved and open to the public [here](https://github.com/obewanjacobi/gradwork/tree/master/Classes/Old%20Qualifying%20Exams/My%20Solutions). To see the qualifying exams for yourself, [visit this link](http://www.math.louisville.edu/GraduateFAQ/qualifiers/QualifierStudyGuides/). When referencing the Perko book, this is in reference to the *Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, 3rd Edition*. Thank you for reading, and for all advice.

# My Solutions from Quals

## Summer 2016

### Consider the initial value problem in $\mathbb{R}$ where $\dot{x} = x^2$ and $x(0) = 1$. (a) Find the first three successive approximations $u_1(t), u_2(t),$ and $u_3(t)$ by using integration. (b) Use mathematical induction to show that for all $n \geq 1$, $u_n(t) = 1+t+...+t^n+O(t)$. (c) Solve the IVP and show that the function $x(t) = \frac{1}{1-t}$ is a solution on the interval $(-\infty,1)$. (d) Show that the first $(n+1)$-terms in $u_n(t)$ agree with the first $(n+1)$-terms in Taylor series of the function $x(t) = \frac{1}{1-t}$ about $t=0$.
#### My Solution:



### Show that the system with $\dot{x} = y$ and $\dot{y} = -2x-y-3x^4+y^2$ has no limit cycle in $\mathbb{R}^2$. (HINT: a function in the form $\mathrm{e}^{\beta x}$ might be useful)
#### My Solution:



### Consider the following model defined in $\mathbb{D} = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x \geq 0, y\geq 0\}$: $\dot{x} = 1-x-\frac{2xy}{2+x}$, $\dot{y} = y \left( \frac{2x}{2+x} -1\right)$ where $x(0) > 0$ and $y(0) > 0$. 
### (a) Show that the $\omega$-limit set of any orbit is on the set $K = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{D} : x+y = 1\}$. (b) Show that the system has a unique steady state in $\mathbb{D}$ and the unique equilibrium point is globally stable in $\mathbb{D}$.
#### My Solution:



### Show that the system with $\dot{x} = x-y-(x^2 + \frac{3}{2} y^2)x$ and $\dot{y} = x+y-(x^2 + \frac{1}{2} y^2)y$ has a limit cycle.
#### My Solution:



### Determine the qualitative behavior near the non-hyperbolic critical point at the origin for the system with $\dot{x} = xy$ and $\dot{y} = -y-x^2$. Sketch the phase portrait.
#### My Solution:



### Consider the Lorenz model with $\dot{x} = \frac{3}{2}y-x$, $\dot{y} = \frac{1}{2}x-y-xz$, and $\dot{z} = xy-z$.
### (a) Show that the Lorenz model has a unique equilibrium point. (b) Show that the equilibrium point is globally stable. (HINT: Use a Liapunov function.)
#### My Solution:



### Consider a spring-mass system that describes a motion with a force caused by friction or magnification or both: $\ddot{x} - \epsilon \dot{x} +x - x^3 + x^5 = 0$ where $\epsilon \in (-2,2)$. 
### (a) Without solving the equation, show that $\epsilon = 0$ is a bifurcation point. In more details, show that when $\epsilon = 0$ the system is a Hamiltonian system and find an expression for the Hamiltonian. Then sow that when $\epsilon < 0$ the origin is a stable equilibrium point; but when $\epsilon > 0$ the system has a limit cycle. (b) Classify the type of the bifurcation and then draw the bifurcation diagram. Label the diagram clearly.

### Consider the mass spring system subject to an external force $f(t)$:

$$\ddot{x}+\dot{x}+x=f(t)$$

### Assume $x(0) = 0$ and $\dot{x}(0) = 0$. Assume also that $f(t)$ is the force describing the striking effect on the mass of the mass spring system in a short time period $0<T<\frac{1}{2}$, given as $f(t) = \frac{\pi}{4T}\sin{\frac{\pi t}{2T}}$ when $0 \leq t<2T$ and $f(t) = 0$ when $t \geq 2T$. 

### (a) Solve the given IVP first for all $t \geq 0$. (b) Compute the limits $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)$ and $\lim_{t \to \infty} \dot{x}(t)$. (c) Compute the limits $\lim_{T \to 0}x(T)$ and $\lim_{T \to 0} \dot{x}(T)$, and discuss their physical meanings.
#### My Solution:



### Suppose that the motion of a mass is described by the nonlinear differential equation $\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + 2x+3(\frac{dx}{dt})^5 = 0$. Determine how solutions of this equation behave.
#### My Solution:


















## Summer 2015

### Consider the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with $\dot{x} = x(2-y)$ and $\dot{y} = y(x-1)$. Show that every non-constant positive solution is periodic.
#### My Solution:
First note that 
$$\dot{x} = x(2-y) = 0 \implies x = 0, y = 2$$
and
$$\dot{y} = y(x-1) = 0 \implies y = 0, x =1$$

Thus we let $E_0 = (0,0)$ and $E_1 = (1,2)$. Then
$$\dot{V} = \left( 1- \frac{1}{x} \right)(2x-xy)+ \left( 1- \frac{2}{y}  \right)(yx-y)$$
$$= 2x-xy-2+y+yx-y-2x+2 = 0$$

Thus every trajectory along the closed curve $V(x,y) = c$ where $c$ is constant. Thus every non-constant positive solution is periodic.


### Consider the system

$$\dot{x} = y+x\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \sin \left({\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}} \right), \dot{y} = -x +y \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \sin \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \right)$$

### Show that this system has infinitely many limit cycles, and discuss how the solutions behavior. (Hint: use polar coordinates.)
#### My Solution:
$$\dot{r} = r^{-1}\left[\left(y+xr \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)x + \left(-x+yr \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)y\right]$$
$$=r^{-1}\left(xy+x^2 r \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) -xy + y^2 r \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right) \right) = r^{-1}r \sin\left( \frac{1}{r}\right)\left( x^2 + y^2 \right)$$
$$=r^2 \left[ \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) \right] = r^2 \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)$$

Note that $r^2 \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)$ equals $0$ on $r = k \pi$. Thus we have an infinite number of limit cycles. 

Now 
$$\dot{\theta} = r^{-2}(x\dot{y}-y\dot{x}) = r^{-2}\left(x\left(-x+yr\sin\left( \frac{1}{r} \right) \right) -y\left(y+xr \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)\right)$$
$$= r^{-2}\left(-x^2 + xyr \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right) - y^2 - xyr \sin \left(\frac{1}{r} \right)\right)= r^{-2}\left(-r^2\right) = -1<0$$

Thus the trajectories go clockwise.


### The Hamiltonian function of a Hamiltonian system is given by $H(x,y) = \frac{y^2}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4}$. (a) Find the equilibria of the system and discuss their stability. (b) Sketch the phase portrait for the system.
#### My Solution:
a)


b)



### Consider the predator-prey model

$$\dot{x} = x \left(6-x-\frac{3y}{1+x} \right), \dot{y} = y(x-2)$$

### Assume that all positive solutions are bounded. (a) Find all critical points and determine their local stability. (b) Show that this system has a limit cycle in the first quadrant.
#### My Solution:



### Suppose that the motion of a mass is described by the nonlinear differential equation $\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \frac{dx}{dt} + x^5 = 0$. Determine how solutions of this equation behave.
#### My Solution:
