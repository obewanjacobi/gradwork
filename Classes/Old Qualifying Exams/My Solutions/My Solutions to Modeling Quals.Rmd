# My Solutions from Quals

## Summer 2016

### Consider the initial value problem in $\mathbb{R}$ where $\dot{x} = x^2$ and $x(0) = 1$. (a) Find the first three successive approximations $u_1(t), u_2(t),$ and $u_3(t)$ by using integration. (b) Use mathematical induction to show that for all $n \geq 1$, $u_n(t) = 1+t+...+t^n+O(t)$. (c) Solve the IVP and show that the function $x(t) = \frac{1}{1-t}$ is a solution on the interval $(-\infty,1)$. (d) Show that the first $(n+1)$-terms in $u_n(t)$ agree with the first $(n+1)$-terms in Taylor series of the function $x(t) = \frac{1}{1-t}$ about $t=0$.
#### My Solution:

(a)
Recall
$$u_{k+1}(t) = x_0 + \int_0 ^t f(u_k(s))ds$$

This implies that
$$u_1(t) = x_0 + \int_0 ^t f(x_0) ds \implies 1+ \int_0 ^t 1 ds = 1+t$$,
$$u_2(t) = 1 + \int_0 ^t f(1+s)ds = 1+ \int_0 ^t (s^2 + 2s + 1)ds$$
$$= 1 + \frac{t^3}{3} + t^2 + t$$,

$$u_3(t) = 1+ \int^t _0 f \left(1+s+s^2 +\frac{s^3}{3} \right)ds$$
$$ = 1+ \int^t _0 \left( 1+2s+3s^2+\frac{8s^3}{3} + \frac{5s^4}{3}+\frac{2s^5}{3}+\frac{s^6}{9} \right)ds$$
$$=1+t+t^2+t^3+\frac{2t^4}{3}+\frac{t^5}{3}+\frac{t^6}{9}+\frac{t^7}{63}$$

(b)
Base case: Above, this holds for $u_1,u_2,$ and $u_3$. Suppose it is true for $n-1$, i.e. 
$$u_{n-1}(t) = 1+t+...+t^{n-1}+O(t)$$
Then $u_n = x_0 \int^t _0 f(u_{n-1} (s))ds$. Thus
$$u_n = 1+ \int^t _0 f(1+s+s^2 +...+s^{n-1} + O(t))ds$$
$$= 1+\int^t _0 \left( 1+ 2s +3s^2 + ... + n s^{n-1} + O(t) \right)ds$$
$$=1+t+t^2 +t^3+...+t^n + O(t)$$ as needed. QED

(c)
$\dot x =x^2$ and $x(0) = 1$. So $\int \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \int 1dt$ which implies that $\frac{-1}{x} = t+c$ giving us $x = \frac{-1}{t+c}$. Then we can see that using our initial condition, we get that $x(0) = - \frac{1}{0+c}$. So
$$1 = -\frac{1}{c} \implies c = -1$$
Thus $$x(t) = - \frac{1}{t-1} = \frac{1}{1-t}$$

Note $x(t)$ is undefined at $t=1$ so by definition of the solution $x(t)$ is only a solution on the interval $(- \infty , 1)$.

(d)
The Taylor series of $\frac{1}{1-t}$ at $t=0$ is $1+t+t^2 +...+t^{n+1}$. By induction we used above, we know that 
$$u_{n+1}(t) = 1+t+t^2 +... + t^{n+1} + O(t)$$
So they do in fact agree up to higher order terms.

### Show that the system with $\dot{x} = y$ and $\dot{y} = -2x-y-3x^4+y^2$ has no limit cycle in $\mathbb{R}^2$. (HINT: a function in the form $\mathrm{e}^{\beta x}$ might be useful)
#### My Solution:

Consider $\beta = -2$. Then
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-2x} \cdot y \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-2x} \cdot (-2x-y-3x^4+y^2) \right)$$
$$=-2 \mathrm{e}^{-2x} \cdot y + \mathrm{e}^{-2x} \cdot (-1+2y) = - \mathrm{e}^{-2x}<0$$
Now we apply Dulac's Criteria, and we have proven that there are no limit cycles in $\mathbb{R}^2$.


### Consider the following model defined in $\mathbb{D} = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x \geq 0, y\geq 0\}$: $\dot{x} = 1-x-\frac{2xy}{2+x}$, $\dot{y} = y \left( \frac{2x}{2+x} -1\right)$ where $x(0) > 0$ and $y(0) > 0$. 
### (a) Show that the $\omega$-limit set of any orbit is on the set $K = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{D} : x+y = 1\}$. (b) Show that the system has a unique steady state in $\mathbb{D}$ and the unique equilibrium point is globally stable in $\mathbb{D}$.
#### My Solution:

(a)
Consider the Liapunov function
$$V = (x+y-1)^2$$
Its derivative along the trajectories of the system is 
$$\dot V = 2(x+y-1)(\dot x + \dot y) = 2(x+y-1)\left( 1-x- \frac{2xy}{2+x} + {2xy}{2+x} - y \right)$$
$$=2(x+y-1)(1-x-y) = -2V^2 \leq 0,$$
Thus according to the [LaSalle's invairance principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaSalle%27s_invariance_principle#Global_version), the $\omega$-limit set of the system is contained in $K$.

(b)
The right part of the system is equal to zero iff $x=1$, $y=0$, thus, $(1,0)$ is a unique stady state. $\dot y$ is negative on $K$ except for the point $(1,0)$ (because $\frac{2x}{2+x}<1$ for any $x<2$), thus, $y$ is decreasing along the trajectories on $K$, thus, any solution that contained in $K$ moves toward the point $(1,0)$. It means that the $\omega$-limit set of the system contains the point $(1,0)$ only, i.e. for any initial point in $\mathbb{D}$, $\lim_{t \to \infty} (x(t),y(t))=(1,0).$

In order to prove the global asymptotic stability of $(1,0)$ we need also to prove its (local) Lyapunov stability. It is given by the Lyapunov function $W(x,y) = V(x,y) + y^2$ since the derivative is 
$$\dot W = -2V^2 + 2y^2 \left( \frac{2x}{2+x}-1 \right)$$
is negative in some neighborhood of the equilibrium point $(1,0)$.

Note, we chose these $V$ and $W$ functions because of the following:

In the first case we know the function must be equal to zero on $K$ and positive on $\mathbb{D}/ K$. In the second case, it was just a guess. The simplest possible Lyapunov function is a quadratic form. We need a positive definite quadratic form; $V$ is not positive definite. What can we do to $V$ in order to obtain a positive definite quadratic form? $(x-1)^2$ and $y^2$, fir instance. $y^2$ is suitable for us because its derivative is $\leq 0$ and the overall derivative is negative definite.


### Show that the system with $\dot{x} = x-y-(x^2 + \frac{3}{2} y^2)x$ and $\dot{y} = x+y-(x^2 + \frac{1}{2} y^2)y$ has a limit cycle.
#### My Solution:

Let $\dot x$ and $\dot y$ be defined as above. Then the equilibrium point of this system is $x=0$ and $y=0$. The Jacobian matrix gives us
$$Df(0,0) = \left( \begin{matrix}1 & -1\\ 1 & 1\end{matrix}\right)$$
The eigenvalues are $1+i$ and $1-i$. Hence the system is unstable (node or focus), which is the ***first*** criterion of the Poincare-Bendixon theorem.

Secondly, let us choose a closed bounded subset given by 
$$V(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \leq c$$
where $c$ is a positive constant. Therefore the closed subset $V(x,y)$ is a circle of radius $\sqrt c$.
We only need to show that there exists a finite value of $c$ for which the vector field of $f(x,y)$ never leaves the set enclosed by $c$. This is identical to the statement:
$$\nabla V(x,y) \cdot f(x,y) \leq 0$$

Now,
$$\nabla V(x,y) \cdot f(x,y) = \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \dot x + \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} \dot y$$

Therefore
$$\nabla V(x,y) \cdot f(x,y) = 2x \left[ x-y-\left( x^2 + \frac{3}{2} y^2 \right) x \right]+ 2y \left[ x+y- \left(x^2+ \frac{1}{2} y^2 \right) y\right]$$
$$=2(x^2 + y^2) - 2(x^2 + y^2)^2 + y^4 -x^2 y^2$$

But
$$y^4 - x^2 y^2 \leq (x^2 + y^2)^2$$

Therefore
$$2(x^2+y^2) - 2(x^2+y^2)^2 +y^4 -x^2y^2 \leq 2(x^2+y^2) - 2(x^2+y^2)^2-(x^2+y^2)$$
$$= 2(x^2+y^2)-(x^2+y^2)^2$$

This implies that
$$\nabla V(x,y) \cdot f(x,y) \leq 2(x^2+y^2 - (x^2+y^2)^2 = 2c-c^2 = (2-c)c$$

Finally if we choose $c=2$ we are guaranteed that $\nabla V(x,y) \cdot f(x,y) \leq 0$ which satisfies the ***second*** criterion of the Poincare-Bendixson theorem. 

Therefore it can be concluded that a limit cycle does indeed exist. QED


### Determine the qualitative behavior near the non-hyperbolic critical point at the origin for the system with $\dot{x} = xy$ and $\dot{y} = -y-x^2$. Sketch the phase portrait.
#### My Solution:

First off, here it is easy to tell that the only equilibrium point we have here is indeed the origin. Next, let's discuss the behavior of this solution point.

$$Df(x,y) = \left( \begin{matrix}y & x\\ -2x & -1\end{matrix}\right)$$
$$Df(0,0) = \left( \begin{matrix}0 & 0\\ 0 & -1\end{matrix}\right)$$

We get then that our eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\lambda_2 = -1$. This shows us that the point is indeed stable, and will behave similarly to a stable node. In other words, any solution will sink towards the origin, however, when approaching from $y > 0$, the trajectory will move around the origin because of the first zero eigenvalue.

### Consider the Lorenz model with $\dot{x} = \frac{3}{2}y-x$, $\dot{y} = \frac{1}{2}x-y-xz$, and $\dot{z} = xy-z$.
### (a) Show that the Lorenz model has a unique equilibrium point. (b) Show that the equilibrium point is globally stable. (HINT: Use a Liapunov function.)
#### My Solution:

(a)
In order to find the equilibrium points, we set $0 = \frac{3}{2} y -x$, $0 = \frac{1}{2}x-y-xz$, and $0 = xy-z$. Then using the first equation, we find that 
$$x = \frac{3}{2}y$$
Inputting this into the third equation gives us 
$$\frac{3}{2}y^2 -z = 0 \implies \frac{3}{2}y^2 = z$$

So finally using the second equation, we get that 
$$0 = \frac{3}{4} y -y- \frac{3}{2}y \cdot \frac{3}{2}y^2 \implies 0=y+9y^3$$
which can only happen if $y=0$. Thus we find that our only possible equilibrium point is the trivial one, $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0)$. 

(b)
Consider $V(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2$. Then 
$$\frac{d}{dt}V(x,y,z) = 2x \dot x + 4y \dot y + 4z \dot z$$
$$= 2x \left( \frac{3}{2}y-x \right) +4y \left( \frac{1}{2}x-y-xz \right) +4z(xy-z) = 5xy-2x^2-4y^2-4z^2$$

This is a negative definite quadratic form, therefore it is less than $0$ unless $x=y=z=0$. Moreover there is some $k>0$ such that $\frac{d}{dt}V(x,y,z) \leq -k V(x,y,z)$. Therefore for any initial point $x(0), y(0),z(0)$, $V(x,y,z) \leq V(x(0),y(0),z(0)) \mathrm{e}^{-kt}$. In particular, this tells us that $(x,y,z) \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$. Thus our equilibrium point is indeed globally stable. 



### Consider a spring-mass system that describes a motion with a force caused by friction or magnification or both: $\ddot{x} - \epsilon \dot{x} +x - x^3 + x^5 = 0$ where $\epsilon \in (-2,2)$. 
### (a) Without solving the equation, show that $\epsilon = 0$ is a bifurcation point. In more details, show that when $\epsilon = 0$ the system is a Hamiltonian system and find an expression for the Hamiltonian. Then sow that when $\epsilon < 0$ the origin is a stable equilibrium point; but when $\epsilon > 0$ the system has a limit cycle. (b) Classify the type of the bifurcation and then draw the bifurcation diagram. Label the diagram clearly.

### Consider the predator-prey model with $\dot{x} = x(1-x-y)$ and $\dot{y} = (4x-1)y$. Let $x(0)>0$ and $y(0)>0$. Determine $\lim_{t \to \infty}(x(t),y(t))$.
#### My Solution:



### Consider the predator-prey model with $\dot{x} = x(1-y)$ and $\dot{y} = (2x-1)y$. Show that every non-constant positive solution is periodic.
#### My Solution:



### Prove that the system with $\dot{x} = x+y-4x^3$ and $\dot{y} = y-x-4y^3$ has a limit cycle.
#### My Solution:



### Consider $\dot{x} = y+x^2-y^2$ and $\dot{y} = -x-2xy$. (a) Find all equilibria for this system and determine their stability. (b) Find the Hamiltonian of the system. (c) Find a solution curve that connects a saddle point. (d) Does the curve obtained in (c) connect any other saddle points?
#### My Solution:
a)


b)


c)


d)




### Consider the mass spring system subject to an external force $f(t)$:

$$\ddot{x}+\dot{x}+x=f(t)$$

### Assume $x(0) = 0$ and $\dot{x}(0) = 0$. Assume also that $f(t)$ is the force describing the striking effect on the mass of the mass spring system in a short time period $0<T<\frac{1}{2}$, given as $f(t) = \frac{\pi}{4T}\sin{\frac{\pi t}{2T}}$ when $0 \leq t<2T$ and $f(t) = 0$ when $t \geq 2T$. 

### (a) Solve the given IVP first for all $t \geq 0$. (b) Compute the limits $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)$ and $\lim_{t \to \infty} \dot{x}(t)$. (c) Compute the limits $\lim_{T \to 0}x(T)$ and $\lim_{T \to 0} \dot{x}(T)$, and discuss their physical meanings.
#### My Solution:



### Suppose that the motion of a mass is described by the nonlinear differential equation $\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + 2x+3(\frac{dx}{dt})^5 = 0$. Determine how solutions of this equation behave.
#### My Solution:


















## Summer 2015

### Consider the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with $\dot{x} = x(2-y)$ and $\dot{y} = y(x-1)$. Show that every non-constant positive solution is periodic.
#### My Solution:
First note that 
$$\dot{x} = x(2-y) = 0 \implies x = 0, y = 2$$
and
$$\dot{y} = y(x-1) = 0 \implies y = 0, x =1$$

Thus we let $E_0 = (0,0)$ and $E_1 = (1,2)$. Then
$$\dot{V} = \left( 1- \frac{1}{x} \right)(2x-xy)+ \left( 1- \frac{2}{y}  \right)(yx-y)$$
$$= 2x-xy-2+y+yx-y-2x+2 = 0$$

Thus every trajectory along the closed curve $V(x,y) = c$ where $c$ is constant. Thus every non-constant positive solution is periodic.


### Consider the system

$$\dot{x} = y+x\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \sin \left({\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}} \right), \dot{y} = -x +y \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \sin \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \right)$$

### Show that this system has infinitely many limit cycles, and discuss how the solutions behavior. (Hint: use polar coordinates.)
#### My Solution:
$$\dot{r} = r^{-1}\left[\left(y+xr \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)x + \left(-x+yr \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)y\right]$$
$$=r^{-1}\left(xy+x^2 r \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) -xy + y^2 r \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right) \right) = r^{-1}r \sin\left( \frac{1}{r}\right)\left( x^2 + y^2 \right)$$
$$=r^2 \left[ \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) \right] = r^2 \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)$$

Note that $r^2 \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right)$ equals $0$ on $r = k \pi$. Thus we have an infinite number of limit cycles. 

Now 
$$\dot{\theta} = r^{-2}(x\dot{y}-y\dot{x}) = r^{-2}\left(x\left(-x+yr\sin\left( \frac{1}{r} \right) \right) -y\left(y+xr \sin\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right)\right)$$
$$= r^{-2}\left(-x^2 + xyr \sin \left( \frac{1}{r} \right) - y^2 - xyr \sin \left(\frac{1}{r} \right)\right)= r^{-2}\left(-r^2\right) = -1<0$$

Thus the trajectories go clockwise.


### The Hamiltonian function of a Hamiltonian system is given by $H(x,y) = \frac{y^2}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4}$. (a) Find the equilibria of the system and discuss their stability. (b) Sketch the phase portrait for the system.
#### My Solution:
a)


b)



### Consider the predator-prey model

$$\dot{x} = x \left(6-x-\frac{3y}{1+x} \right), \dot{y} = y(x-2)$$

### Assume that all positive solutions are bounded. (a) Find all critical points and determine their local stability. (b) Show that this system has a limit cycle in the first quadrant.

# Important Notes

## Notes from Perko Book

Please note, this does not contain anywhere near all of the information contained in the Perko book. Instead, I have only chosen to include what seems absolutely necessary for the exam.

### Linear Systems

- A *phase portrait* of a system of differential equations with $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of all solution curves of the DE in the phase space of $\mathbb{R}^n$

- Find eigenvalues using the following: $\det(A-\lambda I) = 0$. For a $2 \times 2$ matrix, this simplifies to 
$$\lambda_1 = \frac{a+d}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{(a+d)^2}{4-ad+bc}}$$
$$\lambda_2 = \frac{a+d}{2}-\sqrt{\frac{(a+d)^2}{4-ad+bc}}$$
where our matrix is $A = \bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}a & b\\ c & d\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$

- Let $A$ be a square matrix, then 
$$\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{e}^{At} = A \mathrm{e}^{At}$$



### Nonlinear Systems: Local Theory

- The linear transformation $D \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ is called the *derivative* of $\mathbf{f}$ at $\mathbf{x}_0$.

- Suppose that $\mathbf{f}: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is differentiable on $E$. Then $\mathbf{f} \in C^1(E)$ if the derivative $D\mathbf{f}:E \rightarrow L(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is continuous on $E$.

- A point $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is called an *equilibrium point* or *critical point* of the nonlinear system if $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)= \mathbf{0}$. An equilibrium point $\mathbf{x}_0$ is called a *hyperbolic equilibrium point* of the nonlinear system if none of the eigenvalues of the matrix $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ have zero real part. The linear system with the matrix $A = D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ is called the *linearization* of the nonlinear system at $\mathbf{x}_0$.

***The following 3 facts are important!***

- An equilibrium point $\mathbf{x}_0$ of the nonlinear system is called a *sink* if all of the eigenvalues of the matrix $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ have negative real part. 

- An equilibrium point $\mathbf{x}_0$ of the nonlinear system is called a *source* if all of the eigenvalues of $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ have positive real part. 

- An equilibrium point $\mathbf{x}_0$ of the nonlinear system is called a *saddle* if it is a hyperbolic equilibrium point and $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ has at least one eigenvalue with a positive real part and at least one with a negative real part.

- Any sink is asymptotically stable, and any source or saddle is unstable. Hence any hyperbolic equilibrium point is either asymptotically stable or unstable.

- If $\mathbf{x}_0$ is a stable equilibrium point, no eigenvalue of $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ has positive real part.

- A function $V: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the hypotheses of the below theorem is called a *Liapunov function*

- Let $E$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing $\mathbf{x}_0$. Suppose that $\mathbf{f} \in C^1(E)$ and that $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)=\mathbf{0}$. Suppose further that there exists a real valued function $V \in C^1(E)$ satisfying $V(\mathbf{x}_0) = 0$ and $V(\mathbf{x}) >0$ if $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}_0$. Then (a) if $\dot{V}(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in E$, $\mathbf{x}_0$ is stable; (b) if $\dot{V}(\mathbf{x}) < 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in E \sim \{\mathbf{x}_0\}$, $\mathbf{x}_0$ is asymptotically stable; (c) if $\dot{V}(\mathbf{x}) > 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in E \sim \{\mathbf{x}_0\}$, $\mathbf{x}_0$ is unstable.

- If $\dot{V}(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in E$ then the trajectories of the system lie on the surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$) defined by $V(\mathbf{x}) = c$.

***Note the below 6 facts refer to a two dimentional system, ie. a two dimensional $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ matrix***

- If you have two negative real eigenvalues for $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$, then you have a *stable node*.

- If you have two complex eigenvalues with a negative real part for $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$, then you have a *stable focus*.

- If you have two positive real eigenvalues for $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$, then you have an *unstable node*.

- If you have two complex eigenvalues both with a positive real part for $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$, then you have an *unstable focus*.

- If you have one positive real eigenvalue and one negative real eigenvalue for $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$, then you have a *saddle*. 

- If you have two complex eigenvalues with real part zero for $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0)$ then you have a *center*.

- Let $E$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and let $H \in C^2(E)$ where $H = H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ with $\mathbf{x,y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. A system of the form
$$\mathbf{\dot{x}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{y}}$$
$$\mathbf{\dot{y}} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$$
where $\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$ and $\frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{y}}$ is called a *Hamiltonian system* with $n$ degrees of freedom on $E$.

- (Conservation of Energy) The total energy $H(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ of the Hamiltonian system remains constant along the trajectories of the system.

- The total energy for this system $H(x,y) = T(y) + U(x)$ where $T(y) = \frac{y^2}{2}$ is the kinetic energy and 
$$U(x) = - \int_{x_0} ^x f(s) ds$$
is the potential energy.

- The critical points of the Newtonian system all lie on the $x$-axis. The point $x_0,0$ is a critical point of the Newtonian system iff it is a critical point of the function $U(x)$, i.e., a zero of the function $f(x)$. If $(x_0,0)$ is a strict local maximum of the analytic function $U(x)$, it is a saddle for the system. If $(x_0,0)$ is a strict local minimum of the analytic function $U(x)$, it is a center for the system. If $(x_0,0)$ is a horizontal inflection point of the function $U(x)$, it is a cusp for the system. And finally, the phase portrait of the system is symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis.

- Let $E$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $V \in C^2(E)$. A system of the form 
$$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = - \nabla V(\mathbf{x})$$
where 
$$\nabla V = \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x_1},..., \frac{\partial V}{ \partial x_n} \right)^T$$
is called a *gradient system on* $E$.



### Nonlinear Systems: Global Theory

- A point $\mathbf{p} \in E$ is an $\omega$-*limit point* of the trajectory $\phi (*,\mathbf{x})$ of the system if there is a sequence $t_n \to \infty$ such that
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \phi(t_n,\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{p}$$.

- Similarly to above, if there is a sequence $t_n \to - \infty$ such that 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \phi(t_n, \mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{q}$$, at the point $\mathbf{q} \in E$, then the point $\mathbf{q}$ is called an $\alpha$-*limit point* of the trajectory.

- The $\alpha$ and $\omega$-limit sets of a trajectory $\Gamma$ of the system, $\alpha(\Gamma)$ and $\omega(\Gamma)$, are closed subsets of $E$ and if $\Gamma$ is contained in a compact subset of the $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\alpha(\Gamma)$ and $\omega(\Gamma)$, are non-empty, connected, compact subsets of $E$. 

- A *cycle* or *periodic orbit* of a system is any closed solution curve of the system which is not an equilibrium point of the system

- A *limit cycle* $\Gamma$ of a planar system is a cycle of the system which is the $\alpha$ or $\omega$-limit set of some trajectory of the system other than $\Gamma$. 

- If a cycle $\Gamma$ is the $\omega$-limit set of every trajectory in some neighborhood of $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma$ is called an $\omega$-*limit cycle* or *stable limit cycle*; if $\Gamma$ is the $\alpha$-limit set of every trajectory in some neighborhood of $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma$ is called an $\alpha$-*limit cycle* or an *unstable limit cycle*; and if $\Gamma$ is the $\omega$-limit set of one trajectory other than $\Gamma$ and the $\alpha$-limit set of another trajectory other than $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma$ is called a *semi-stable limit cycle*.

- (**Dulac**) In any bounded region of the plane, a planar analytic system with $\mathbf{f(x)}$ analytic in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has at most a finite number of limit cycles. Any polynomial system has at most a finite number of limit cycles in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

- (**Poincare**) A planar analytic system cannot have an infinite number of limit cycles which accumulate on a cycle of the system.

- If $\Gamma$ and $\omega(\Gamma)$ have a point in common, then $\Gamma$ is either a critical point or a periodic orbit.

- If $\omega(\Gamma)$ contains no critical points $\omega(\Gamma)$ contains a periodic orbit $\Gamma_0$, then $\omega(\Gamma) = \Gamma_0$.

- (**Bendixson's Criteria**) Let $\mathbf{f} \in C^1(E)$ where $E$ is a simply connected region in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If the divergence of the vector field $\mathbf{f}, \nabla \mathbf{f}$ is not identically zero and does not change sign in $E$, then the system has no closed orbit lying entirely in $E$.

- (**Dulac's Criteria**) Let $\mathbf{f} \in C^1(E)$ where $E$ is a simply connected region in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If there exists a function $B \in C^1(E)$ such that $\nabla (B\mathbf{f})$ is not identically zero and does not change sign in $E$, then the system has no closed orbit lying entirely in $E$. If $A$ is an annular region contained in $E$ on which $\nabla(B\mathbf{f})$ does not change sign, then there is at most one limit cycle of the system in $A$.




### Nonlinear Systems: Bifurcation Theory

- (**Sotomayor**) Suppose that $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mu _0) = \mathbf{0}$ and that the $n \times n$ matrix $A = D \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mu_0)$ has a simple eigenvalue $\lambda=0$ with eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ and that $A^T$ has an eigenvector $\mathbf{w}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda = 0$. Furthermore, suppose that $A$ has $k$ eigenvalues with negative real part and $(n-k-1)$ eigenvalues with positive real part and the following conditions are satisfied:
$$\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{f}_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_0,\mu_0) \neq 0, \mathbf{w}^T[D^2 \mathbf{f} (\mathbf{x}_0, \mu_0)(\mathbf{v,v})] \neq 0$$
Then there is a smooth curve of equilibrium points of the system in $\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}$ passing through $(\mathbf{x}_0,\mu_0)$ and tangent to the hyperplane $\mathbb{R}^n \times \{\mu_0\}$. Depending on the signs of the expressions in the conditions, there are no equilibrium points of the system near $\mathbf{x}_0$ when $\mu<\mu_0$ (or when $\mu > \mu_0$) and there are two equilibrium points of the system near $\mathbf{x}_0$ when $\mu > \mu_0$ (or when $\mu < \mu_o$). The two equilibrium points of the system near $\mathbf{x}_0$ are hyperbolic and have stable manifolds of dimensions $k$ and $k+1$ respectively. I.E. the system experiences a **saddle-node** bifurcation at the equilibrium point $\mathbf{x}_0$ as the parameter $\mu$ passes through the bifurcation value $\mu = \mu_0$. The set of $C^{\infty}$-vector fields satisfying the above condition is an open, dense subset in the Banach space of all $C^{\infty}$, one-parameter, vector fields with an equilibrium point at $\mathbf{x}_0$ having a simple zero eigenvalue.

- If the above conditions are changed to
$$\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{f}_{\mu} (\mathbf{x}_0,\mu_0) = 0,$$
$$\mathbf{w}^T[D\mathbf{f}_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_0,\mu_0)\mathbf{v}] \neq 0,$$
$$\mathbf{w}^T[D^2\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0,\mu_0)(\mathbf{v,v})] \neq 0$$
then the system experiences a **transcritical bifurcation**.

- If the above conditions are changed to
$$\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{f}_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mu_0) = 0,$$
$$\mathbf{w}^T [D \mathbf{f}_{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mu_0)\mathbf{v}] \neq 0,$$
$$\mathbf{w}^T[D^2 \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mu_0) (\mathbf{v,v})] = 0,$$
$$\mathbf{w}^T [D^3 \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0, \mu_0) (\mathbf{v,v,v})] \neq 0$$
then the system experiences a **pitchfork bifurcation**.

- Hopf bifurcations are explained in this book, but I won't include notes on them because I seriously doubt they will be on the exam.
