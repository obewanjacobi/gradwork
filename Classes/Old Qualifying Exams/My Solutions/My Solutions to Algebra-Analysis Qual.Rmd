### Let $(G,Â·)$ be a group and $Z = Z(G)$ its center. Suppose that the group $G/Z$ is cyclic. Show that $G$ is Abelian.
#### My Solution:

Let $G/Z$ be cyclic with generator $xZ$. Every element in $G/Z$ can be written as $x^k Z$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z \in Z$. We want to show first for all $g \in G$ that $g$ can be written in the form $x^k z$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z \in Z$. We know that $G/Z$ is cyclic, so there exists some $g \in G$ such that $gZ = (xZ)^m = x^m Z$ for some $m$. Well, this is true iff $(x^m)^{-1} g \in Z$. So there exists a $z \in Z$ such that $(x^m)^{-1} g = z \implies g = x^m z$.

Now let $g,h \in G$. Then

$$g=x^a z$$ and $$h = x^b w$$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z,w \in Z$. 

Thus 
$$gh = x^a z x^b w = x^{a+b} zw = x^{b+a} wz = x^b w x^a z = hg$$
because $z,w \in Z$. THus $gh = hg$ which implies that G is Abelian. QED



### Prove that every prime ideal is maximal in a PID.
#### My Solution:

Let $P$ be a prime ideal in the PID $R$. So $ab \in P$ iff $a$ or $b \in P$. But $R$ is a PID, so $P =(a)$ where $a \in R$. So we want to show $P$ is maximal using this information, ie. if $I$ is an ideal that contains $P$, then $I=P$ or $I=R$. So let $I$ be an ideal containing $P$ such that $P \subset I \subset R$. Let $I =(b)$ where $B \in R$ because $R$ is a PID. Now, $a \in (a) \subset (b)$ which implies that there exists $c \in R$ such that $a =bc$. Since $a = bc \in P$, we know either $b$ or $c$ is in $P$ because it's prime. 

If $b \in P$, then $I = (b) \subset P$ which implies $P=I$. On the other hand, if $c \in P =(a)$, then there exists $d \in R$ such that $c = ad$. So $$a =bc =bad$$

Because $R$ is an integral domain (because it'e a PID), we can reduce the above formula to $$1 = bd$$

Thus $b$ is a unit which implies that $I = (b) = R$.

Thus either $P=I$ or $I=R$ for all $I$ containing $P$, so $P$ is maximal in $R$.  QED



### Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$. For any two ideals $I$ and $J$ of $R$, let $IJ$ be the ideal generated by all products $xy$ where $x \in I$ and $y\in J$. Suppose $I+J = R$, prove that $IJ = I \cap J$.

#### My Solution:

We will prove this using set containment.

Because $I$ and $J$ are ideals in $R$, for all $x_i \in I$ and all $y_i \in J$, $x_i y_i \in I$ and $x_i y_i \in J$. Moreover, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in I$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in J$. Thus 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in IJ$$
which implies
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in I \cap J$$
Thus $IJ \subset I \cap J$

Now we just need to show that $IJ \supset I \cap J$. To do this we will use the fact that $I+J=R$. Let $a \in I \cap J$. We know $1 \in R = I + J$. So $1 = i + j$ for some $i \in I$ and $j \in J$. Then since $R$ is commutative, 
$$a = a 1 = a (i+j) = ai + aj = ia + aj$$
However $ia \in IJ$ since $i \in I$ and $a \in J$ and $aj \in IJ$ for similar reasons as our previous argument. By the definition of $IJ$, this shows us $a \in IJ$. Thus $I \cap J \subset IJ$.

Thus we've proven that $IJ = I \cap J$ in this circumstance. QED



### Prove that any finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $A_n$ for some $n$, where $A_n$ is the alternating group on $n$ elements.
#### My Solution:

To do this proof, we will use the broader proof of Cayley's Theorem. This theorem states that if $G$ is a group of order $n < \infty$, then $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$. Since $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$, this proof will be sufficient to show the desired result.

Let $S$ be the set of all elements of $G$. Now consider the action of $G$ on $S$,
$$G \times S \rightarrow S, a*b:=ab$$
This action defines a homomorphism $\gamma: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Perm}(S)$. It is fairly easy to see that this homomorphism is one-to-one and onto. Thus, it follows that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Perm}(S)$. And finally, since $|S| = n$ we have that $\mathrm{Perm}(S) \cong S_n$ This tells us that $G \cong S_n$.

Thus we just need to show that $S_n \cong A_m$. Let $\Gamma : S_n \rightarrow A_{n+2}$ such that $\Gamma : \sigma \mapsto \sigma$ if $\sigma$ is even, or $\Gamma : \sigma \mapsto (n+1 \ n+2) \sigma$ if $\sigma$ is odd where $\sigma \in S_n$. We just need to show that $\Gamma$ is an isomorphism. Let $\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in S_n$. If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ are even, then 
$$\Gamma (\sigma_1 \sigma_2) = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \Gamma (\sigma_1) \Gamma (\sigma_2)$$
If $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ are both odd, then 
$$\Gamma (\sigma_1 \sigma_2) = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \Gamma (\sigma_1) \Gamma (\sigma_2)$$ This is true because $(n+1 \ n+2)^2$ is the identity permutation, and $\sigma_1 \sigma_2$ is even.
Finally WLOG let $\sigma_1$ be even and $\sigma_2$ be odd. Then
$$\Gamma(\sigma_1) \Gamma(\sigma_2) = \sigma_1 (n+1 \ n+2) \sigma_2 = (n+1 \ n+2) \sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \Gamma (\sigma_1 \sigma_2)$$
Thus $\Gamma$ is a homomorphism. It is also obvious that for all $\sigma$ there exists a $\Gamma(\sigma)$, so we know that $\Gamma$ is onto. And finally, it is obvious that if $\Gamma(\sigma_1) = \Gamma(\sigma_2)$, then $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2$. Thus $\Gamma$ is an isomorphism.

Using this fact and Cayley's Theorem, we then know that $G \cong S_n \cong A_{n+2}$ which proves that any finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $A_n$. QED



### Determine if the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois.
#### My Solution:

In order to prove that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$ is or is not Galois, we will use the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. Thus, we know if we prove that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is a splitting field over some function $t(x)$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, then we know the extension is Galois. Consider the polynomial $t(x) = x^3 - 2$. This polynomial has no roots in $\mathbb{Q}$, but has root $\sqrt[3]{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$. Unfortunately, this is not enough for us to factor $t(x)$ into linear factors, as we will need some $\omega \in \mathbb{Q}$ to further factor the polynomial. Thus we know that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is not a splitting field, and thus it must not be Galois by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. QED



### Let $G$ be a group. Consider the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of $G$, the subgroup generated by all commutators, $aba^{-1} b^{-1}$ where $a,b \in G$. It is known that $[G,G]$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Prove that a) $G/[G,G]$ is Abelian, and b) if $K \unlhd G$ such that $G/K$ is Abelian, then $[G,G] \unlhd K$.
#### My Solution:
a)
First off, to save time let $[G,G] =C$. So we want to show that for all $aC, bC \in G/C$ that 
$$abC = aCbC = bCaC = baC$$
Well, $aba^{-1} b^{-1}$ generates $C$. So, $C = aba^{-1} b^{-1}C$, which implies that $abC = baC$ through cancellation. Thus $G/C$ is Abelian. QED

b)
So here we want to show that for all $k \in K$ and $aba^{-1} b^{-1} \in C$, $kaba^{-1} b^{-1}k^{-1} \in C$. 
Well, because $K \unlhd G$ and $G/K$ is Abelian, we know that for all $a,b \in G$ that $abK = baK = Kab = Kba$. Using this, we know that $kab = abk$. Thus we can say that $kaba^{-1} b^{-1} k^{-1} = abka^{-1} b^{-1} k^{-1} \in C$ because $abka^{-1} b^{-1} k^{-1}$ is a cummutator. Thus $C \unlhd K$. QED



### Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Prove that the following are equivalent: (a) $R$ is a field; and (b) $R \neq \{0\}$ and the only ideals of $R$ are $\{0\}$ and $R$.
#### My Solution:
($a \implies b$)

Suppose $I$ is a nonzero ideal of a field $R$. So $I$ contains some $0 \neq a$. Then since $R$ is a field, $a^{-1}$ exists and $1 = a^{-1} a \in I$, so $I$ contains $1$ and hence $I = R$. The trivial ideal also exists, and is trivial to show. 

($b \implies a$)

Let $R$ have only two ideals, the trivial and $R$. Suppose $R$ is not a field. Then some nonzero element $a$ does not have an inverse. If we set $aR = \{ar | r \in R \}$. This is a proper nonzero ideal, which gives us a contradiction to our original statement. Thus $R$ must be a field for $R$ to only contain 2 ideals, the trivial and $R$ itself. 

Thus the two statements are equivalent, $R$ is a field and $R$ contains only two ideals, those being the trivial ideal and $R$ itself. QED



### (a) Find the degree $[F: \mathbb{Q}]$ of the extension $F = \mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{3})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Find a basis of the vector space $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. (b) Find a primitive element of the extension $F$ of $\mathbb{Q}$.
#### My Solution:
(a) Here we can use what I like to call the *double extension lemma* to find the degree of the extension. So we know that $[F: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]$. Thus because the minimum polynomials for the extensions are $x^2 +1$ and $x^2 - 3$ respectively, we know that the degree of the extension is $2*2=4$. A basis for this extension is $[1, i, \sqrt{3} , i \sqrt{3}]$. QED

(b) The primitive element of this extension is $i+\sqrt{3}$ as this element makes the simple extension $\mathbb{Q}(i+\sqrt{3}) = F$. This can be shown through the following containment arguments:

First let $\mathbb{Q}(i+\sqrt{3}) = K$. It is obvious that $K \subset F$, so we're good there. Thus we just need to show that $F \subset K$. So we need to show that $i, \sqrt{3} \in K$. Well, let $a = i+\sqrt{3}$. We know $a, a^2 \in K$. $a^2 = -1 +2i \sqrt{3} +3$, which implies that $2i \sqrt{3} \in K$. Then we can look at $2i \sqrt{3} * (i + \sqrt{3}) \in K$ which implies that $3i - \sqrt{3} \in K$, which implies that $(3i-\sqrt{3})+(i +\sqrt{3}) \in K \implies i \in K$. Thus $i+ \sqrt{3} -i \in K \implies \sqrt{3} \in K$. So finally we have proven both directions of containment, implying that the primitive element $i+\sqrt{3}$ makes $F$ into a simple extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ which we call $K$. QED

### Prove that a group of order $300$ cannot be simple.
#### My Solution:
To begin, we must understand what it means for a group to be simple. A simple group is a group of whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the entire group itself. Thus we want to show there are no proper normal subgroups other than the trivial group.

To do this we will use Sylow's Theorem and a proof by contradiction.

Let $G$ be a group of order $300$ such that $G$ is simple. Well, $300 = 3 \times 2^2 \times 5^2$. We will denote the number of Sylow-p subgroups as $n_p$. Notice then that $n_5 | 12$ and $n_5 = 1 + 5k$. This implies that $n_5 = 1$ or $6$. However, because $G$ is simple there cannot only be one Sylow-5 subgroup, otherwise we would have a proper nontrivial normal subgroup. Thus $n_5 = 6$. Because of this and because $G$ is simple, we can say that $G$ embeds into $S_6$ if we let $G$ act on the Sylow-5 subgroups by conjugation. But then by Lagrange's Theorem, $300$ should divide $6!$, which it does not. Thus we have a contradiction, which implies that $G$ is not simple, thus a group of order $300$ cannot be simple. QED



### Let $F = \mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt{3})$ where $i$ is imaginary. Find the degree of the extension $[F:\mathbb{Q}]$ and a basis of $F$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Justify.
#### My Solution:
(a) Here we can use what I like to call the *double extension lemma* to find the degree of the extension. So we know that $[F: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]$. Thus because the minimum polynomials for the extensions are $x^2 +1$ and $x^2 - 3$ respectively, we know that the degree of the extension is $2*2=4$. A basis for this extension is $[1, i, \sqrt{3} , i \sqrt{3}]$. QED

(b) The primitive element of this extension is $i+\sqrt{3}$ as this element makes the simple extension $\mathbb{Q}(i+\sqrt{3}) = F$. This can be shown through the following containment arguments:

First let $\mathbb{Q}(i+\sqrt{3}) = K$. It is obvious that $K \subset F$, so we're good there. Thus we just need to show that $F \subset K$. So we need to show that $i, \sqrt{3} \in K$. Well, let $a = i+\sqrt{3}$. We know $a, a^2 \in K$. $a^2 = -1 +2i \sqrt{3} +3$, which implies that $2i \sqrt{3} \in K$. Then we can look at $2i \sqrt{3} * (i + \sqrt{3}) \in K$ which implies that $3i - \sqrt{3} \in K$, which implies that $(3i-\sqrt{3})+(i +\sqrt{3}) \in K \implies i \in K$. Thus $i+ \sqrt{3} -i \in K \implies \sqrt{3} \in K$. So finally we have proven both directions of containment, implying that the primitive element $i+\sqrt{3}$ makes $F$ into a simple extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ which we call $K$. QED



### Let $A$ and $B$ be ideals of a ring $R$ with $B \subseteq A$. Show that $A/B = \{ a+B|a \in A \}$ is an ideal of the ring $R/B$.
#### My Solution:
Recall for this problem the definition of an ideal for rings. $I$ is an ideal of the ring $R$ if for all $x \in R$ and $y \in I$, then $xy, yx \in I$. 

We will use this definition to show $A/B$ is an ideal of $R/B$. Notice $R/B = \{ r + B|r \in R \}$. So let's consider two elements, $r+B \in R/B$ and $a + B \in A/B$ such that $r \in R$ and $a \in A$. We want to show that $(r+B)(a+B) \in A/B$ and $(a+B)(r+B) \in A/B$. Well, 
$$(r+B)(a+B) = ra+aB+rB+B = ra+B$$ 
because $B$ is an ideal of $R$. But $A$ is also an ideal of $R$ so $ra \in A$, which implies that $ra + B \in A/B$. Looking at the other direction, we find that
$$(a+B)(r+B) = ar+aB+rB+B = ar+B$$
and for similar reasons, we then know that $ar+B \in A/B$. Thus $A/B$ is an ideal of $R/B$. QED

- Note: This statement also follows directly from the third isomorphism threorem for rings.



### Let $A$ and $B$ be ideals of a ring $R$ with $B \subseteq A$. Show that the map $f: R/B \rightarrow R/A$ given by $f(x+B) = x+A$ for every $x \in R$, is well-defined, onto, and a homomorphism.
#### My Solution:
We will need to separate this problem into three parts.

- First we must prove that $f$ is well-defined. So we want to show that if $x=y \in R$, then $f(x+B)=f(y+B)$. Well, if $x=y$, then 
$$f(x+B) = x+A = y+A = f(y+B)$$
Thus $f$ is well-defined by definition.

- Next we will show that $f$ is an onto function. So we need to show that for all $x \in R$, and $x+B \in R/B$, then $f(x+B) \in R/A$. Well, by definition this is obvious, because for all $x \in R$ and $x+B \in R/B$, $f(x+B) = x+A \in R/A$. Thus the function must be onto.

- Finally we must show that $f$ is a homomorphism. First note that $f(B)=A$ by definition, so the identity maps to the respective identity. Now we must prove that addition and multiplication are preserved. First, let's look at $f(x+B+y+B)$ where $x,y \in R$. So,
$$f(x+B+y+B) = f(x+y+b) = x+y+A = (x+A) + (y+A) = f(x+B)+f(y+B)$$
Thus addition is preserved. So now we must only prove that multiplication is preserved. Assume a similar situation as above, but let's look at $f((x+B)(y+B))$. Well,
$$f((x+B)(y+B)) = f(xy+xB+yB+B) = f(xy+B)$$
because $B$ is an ideal. Now we can further this manipulation using that $A$ is an ideal to see that
$$f(xy+B)=xy+A=xy+xA+yA+A=(x+A)(y+A)=f(x+B)f(y+B)$$
Thus because identities, addition, and multiplication are preserved, we know then that $f$ is a homomorphism.

Thus $f$ is a well-defined, onto, homomorphism. QED

- Note, this could have been simplified with the first Isomorphism Theorem for Rings.



### Let $A$ and $B$ be ideals of a ring $R$ with $B \subseteq A$. Show that $(R/B)/(A/B)$ is isomorphic to $R/A$.
#### My Solution:
This statement follows directly from the third Isomorphism Theorem for rings. QED



### Determine the splitting field and its degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ for the polynomial $t(x) = x^6 - 4$. Justify.
#### My Solution:
First note that $t(x) = x^6 -4 = (x^3 - 2)(x^3 + 2)$. The roots of this polynomial are $\sqrt[3]{2}, -\sqrt[3]{2}, i\sqrt[3]{2},-i\sqrt[3]{2}$. We can then see that the splitting field of $t(x)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},i)$. This is the splitting field because in this extension $t(x)$ can be factored into linear factors. QED



### A ring $R$ (not necessarily commutative) with identity $1_R \neq 0$ in which every nonzero element is a unit is called a *division ring* . Prove that a ring $R$ with identity $1_R$ is a division ring iff $R$ has no proper left ideal.
#### My Solution:
First, recall if $I \subset R$, $I$ is a left ideal if for all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$, $ra \in I$.

Assume $R$ has no proper left ideal, thus the only left ideals are the trivial and the entire ring. So if $s \in R$ is nonzero and $R$ has no proper left ideals, then we can define $I := \{rs|r \in R\} =R$ and there exists $r \in R$ such that $rs = 1_R$. Also note 
$$(rs)r=r(sr)=r \implies r(1_R -sr)=0 \implies sr =1_R$$
Because $rs = 1_R = sr$, $R$ must be a division ring.

Now we must prove the other direction. Assume $R$ is a division ring and $I \neq \{0\}$ is a left ideal of $R$. Then for all $s \in I$, 
$$1_R = s^{-1}s \in I \implies I=R$$
Thus $R$ has no proper left ideals. QED.




### Let $G$ be an arbitrary group. For any two subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $G$, define $HK = \{ hk | h \in H, k \in K\}$. Assume $H \unlhd G$ and $K \leq G$. (a) Prove that $HK \leq G$. (b) Prove that $H \unlhd HK$ and $(H \cap K) \unlhd K$. (c) Prove that $\frac{HK}{H} \cong \frac{K}{H \cap K}$.
#### My Solution:
**Note: This is the proof of the 2nd Isomorphism Theorem for Groups**

(a) Recall that $HK$ can only be a subgroup if $HK = KH$. Thus if $H \unlhd G$, and we let $h \in H$ and $k \in K$, by assumption $khk^{-1} \in H$. Thus
$$kh = (khk^{-1})k \in HK$$ 
This proves that $KH \subseteq HK$. Similarly, $hk = k(k^{-1}hk) \in KH$ which proves the reverse containment. Thus $HK \leq G$. QED

(b) Since $K$ normalizes $H$ and $H$ normalizes itself trivially, this implies that $HK$ normalizes $H$. Thus $H \unlhd HK$. Since $H \unlhd HK$, the quotient group $\frac{HK}{H}$ is well defined. Define the map $\Gamma : K \rightarrow \frac{HK}{H}$ by $\Gamma (k) = kH$. Since the group operation in $\frac{HK}{H}$ is well defined, it's easy to see that $\Gamma$ is a homomorphism:
$$\Gamma(k_1 k_2) = (k_1 k_2)H = k_1 H *k_2 H = \Gamma(k_1) \Gamma(k_2)$$
Alternatively, the map $\Gamma$ is just the restriction to the subgroup $K$ of the natural progression homomorphism $\pi : HK \rightarrow \frac{HK}{H}$, so it's also a homomorphism. It is clear then from the definition of $HK$ that $\Gamma$ is onto. The identity of $\frac{HK}{H}$ is simply $H$, so the kernel of $\Gamma$ consists of the elements $k \in K$ with $kH = H$, or where $k \in H$. Thus $\mathrm{ker}\Gamma = H \cap K$. So by the first isomorphism theorem, $H \cap K \unlhd K$. QED

(c) Following the proof of part (b), by the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\frac{HK}{H} \cong \frac{K}{H \cap K}$ QED



### Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x) \in F[x]$. (a) What is the definition of the *splitting field* of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the field $F$. (b) Let $a \in F$. Show that $f(x)$ and $f(x+a)$ have the same splitting field over $F$.
#### My Solution:
(a)
The extension field $K$ of $F$ is a splitting field for the polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ if $f(x)$ factors completely into linear factors in $K[x]$ and $f(x)$ does not factor completely into linear factors over any proper subfield of $K$ containing $F$.

(b)
Let $f(x) = c_1x^n+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+c_1x_c_0$. Let $K$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$. And finally, this all means that $f(x+a) = c_1(x+a)^n+c_{n-1}(x+a)^{n-1}+...+c_1(x+a)+c_0$. Since $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$, we then know that $f(x)$ has roots $r_1,r_2,...,r_n \in K$. Also note that some of these $r_i$ values could be duplicates or even zeroes. So by definition, in $K$, $f(x) = (x+r_1)(x+r_2)...(x+r_n)$. This means that in $K$, $f(x+a) = (x+a+r_1)(x+a+r_2)...(x+a+r_n)$. From here it is easy to see that the roots of $f(x+a)$ are simply $r_1-a,r_2-a,...,r_n-a$. All of these values are in $K$ as well because for all $i$, $r_i \in K$ and $a \in F \subset K$. So because we can factor $f(x+a)$ into linear factors in $K$, $K$ must also be the splitting field of $f(x+a)$. Note, the situation in which we switch assumptions such that $K$ is the splitting field over $f(x+a)$ to prove that $K$ must also be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$ is similar, so we leave this out.

### If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $H$ is any subgroup of $G$, prove that $NH := \{nh|n \in N, h \in H\}$ is a subgroup of $G$.
#### My Solution:
Let $H \leq G$ and $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Let $NH$ be defined as above. So we want to show for all $nh \in NH$, $(nh)^{-1} \in NH$. Well, $(nh)^{-1}=h^{-1}n^{-1}$. First note because $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $H \leq G$, $n^{-1} \in N$ and $h^{-1} \in H$. Also note because $N$ is normal in $G$, for all $g \in G$, $gN = Ng$, ie. for all $n \in N$, $gn = ng$. Thus in $NH$, 
$$nh = hn \implies (nh)^{-1} = h^{-1}n^{-1} = n^{-1}h^{-1} \in NH$$
Thus $NH$ is a subgroup of $G$. QED



### Show that a group of order $56$ is not simple
#### My Solution:
Let $G$ be a group of order $56 = 2^3 * 7$. Then by Sylow's Theorem, $n_2 = 1$ or $7$ and $n_7 = 1$ or $8$. 

Assume $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 8$. Two different Sylow-7 subgroups intersect only in the identity. Also all of the Sylow-7 subgroups are conjugate by Sylow's Theorem, hence they're isomorphic. Then if $n_7 = 8$, we have that $G$ has at least $8*6=48$ elements of order $7$. The rest of the elements must be in a Sylow-2 subgroup which gives us a contradiction. Thus $n_2 =1$ or $n_7=1$, thus $G$ cannot be simple. QED



### A ring $R$ is *Boolean* if every element is idempotent, that is $a^2=a$ for all $a \in R$. Prove that every Boolean ring is commutative.
#### My Solution:
Recall that a ring is commutative if the multiplication operation in the ring is commutative. Thus we want to show that for every Boolean ring, if $a,b \in R$ then $ab = ba$. 

To begin this problem, consider $a+b = (a+b)^2$. Well,
$$(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b)=a(a+b)+b(a+b)$$
$$ = a^2 +ab+ba+b^2=a+ab+ba+b$$
When cancelling $a$ and $b$ from both sides, we find that $0 = ab+ba \implies ab = -ba$, but because $R$ is Boolean, we can easily see that $-c = c$ for all $c \in R$. Thus we have proven that all Boolean rings are indeed commutative. QED.



### Show that every prime element in an integral domain is irreducible.
#### My Solution:
Recall an integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. Also an element in an integral domain is irreducible if it is not equal to the product of two non-units. Also recall that if $R$ is our integral domain, $u \in R$ is a unit if for some $v \in R$, $uv = e$ where $e$ is the identity in $R$. Lastly, recall that $p \in R$ is prime if $p|ab \implies p|a$ or $p|b$. 

Let $p \in R$ be a prime element where $R$ is an integral domain. Assume $p = ab$ where $a,b \in R$. Obviously $p|ab$, so because $p$ is prime, $p|a$ or $p|b$. WLOG, assume $p|a$ such that $px = a$ for some $x \in R$. If $1$ is the identity of $R$, then 
$$1*a=a=px=(ab)x=a(bx)$$
Because $R$ is an integral domain, $a$ can be cancelled out implying that $1=bx$, thus $b$ is a unit. This proves that $p$ is also irreducible in an integral domain. QED.



### Prove or provide a counterexample: Galois extensions of Galois extensions are Galois extensions. That is, if $K/F$ is Galois and $L/K$ is Galois, then $L/F$ is Galois. 
#### My Solution:
This statement is false! Consider $L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2})$, $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, and $F = \mathbb{Q}$. In this case, $K/F$ is Galois because $K$ is a splitting field over $F$, and it is similar for $L/K$. However, $L/F$ is not Galois, as $L$ does not make a splitting field over $F$. This can be seen from the polynomial $f(x)=x^4-2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Not all of the roots of $f(x)$ are contained in $L$, as $L$ does not contain any imaginary numbers. QED



### Let $E$ be a finite extension of field $F$. Prove that $E$ is algebraic over $F$.
#### My Solution:
Assume $E/F$ is finite. Let $\beta \in E/F$. We have then that $F \subseteq F(\beta) \subseteq E$. We know
$$[E:F] =n \in \mathbb{N} \implies [F(\beta):F] \leq n$$
Consider $\{1,\beta,\beta ^2, ..., \beta ^n\} \subseteq E$. So there exists $c_0, ..., c_n \in F$ such that $c_0+ c_1 \beta + ... + c_n \beta ^n =0$, where at least one $c_i \neq 0$. Let $v(x) = c_n x^n +...+c_0$, so $v(\beta) =0$. Thus if $E/F$ is finite, then $E$ is algebraic over $F$. QED



### Find the degree of the extension $[F: \mathbb{Q}]$, where $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1},\sqrt{3})$. Is this a simple extension? Why or why not?
#### My Solution:
(a) Here we can use what I like to call the *double extension lemma* to find the degree of the extension. So we know that $[F: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]$. Thus because the minimum polynomials for the extensions are $x^2 +1$ and $x^2 - 3$ respectively, we know that the degree of the extension is $2*2=4$. A basis for this extension is $[1, i, \sqrt{3} , i \sqrt{3}]$. QED

(b) The primitive element of this extension is $i+\sqrt{3}$ as this element makes the simple extension $\mathbb{Q}(i+\sqrt{3}) = F$. This can be shown through the following containment arguments:

First let $\mathbb{Q}(i+\sqrt{3}) = K$. It is obvious that $K \subset F$, so we're good there. Thus we just need to show that $F \subset K$. So we need to show that $i, \sqrt{3} \in K$. Well, let $a = i+\sqrt{3}$. We know $a, a^2 \in K$. $a^2 = -1 +2i \sqrt{3} +3$, which implies that $2i \sqrt{3} \in K$. Then we can look at $2i \sqrt{3} * (i + \sqrt{3}) \in K$ which implies that $3i - \sqrt{3} \in K$, which implies that $(3i-\sqrt{3})+(i +\sqrt{3}) \in K \implies i \in K$. Thus $i+ \sqrt{3} -i \in K \implies \sqrt{3} \in K$. So finally we have proven both directions of containment, implying that the primitive element $i+\sqrt{3}$ makes $F$ into a simple extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ which we call $K$. QED



### Let $G$ be an arbitrary group with a center $Z(G)$. Prove that the inner automorphism group $Inn(G)$ is isomorphic to $G/Z(G)$. (Recall by definition $Inn(G)$ is the group of all automorphisms $\phi_h$ of the form $\phi_h(g)=h^{-1}gh$, for all $g \in G$.)
#### My Solution:
Consider the map $\theta : G \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ defined as $\theta(g) = \gamma_g$, where $\gamma_g$ is the automorphism of $G$ defined by $\gamma_g(h) = ghg^{-1}$. 

**Lemma 1**: $\theta$ is a homomorphism.

*Proof*: We have $\theta(g_1 g_2) = \gamma_{g_{1}g_{2}}$, and
$$\gamma_{g_{1}g_{2}}(h)=(g_1 g_2)h(g_1 g_2)^{-1} =g_1(g_2 h g_2 ^{-1})g_1 ^{-1} = \gamma_{g_1}(\gamma_{g_2}(h)).$$

**Lemma 2**: $\mathrm{ker}(\theta) = Z(G)$.

*Proof*: We have 
$$ker(\theta) = \{g: \theta (g) = e \} = \{g : \gamma_g = e\}$$
$$= \{g: \gamma_g (h) = h\} = \{g: gh = hg\} = Z(G)$$

Finally, by the first isomorphism theorem, we have $G/ker(\theta) = G/Z(G) \cong im (\theta) = \mathrm{Inn}(G)$, as desired. QED.



### Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H \unlhd G$. Prove that for any Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$, $P \cap H$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$.
#### My Solution:
Since $P \cap H$ is a $p$-group, as it is contained $P$, we only need to show that $P \cap H$ has maximal $p$-power order in $N$. By the Sylow Theorem, $P \cap H$ is contained in a conjugate of $P$, which we'll call $K$ such that $K \subset gPg^{-1}$. Thus $g^{-1}Kg \subset P$. Also $g^{-1}Kg \subset g^{-1}Hg = H$, so $g^{-1}Kg \subset P \cap H \subset K$. Since $|K| = |g^{-1}Kg|$, we get that $|P \cap H| = |K|$, so $P \cap H = K$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $H$. QED



### Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $P \neq R$ be an ideal of $R$. Prove that the following are equivalent: (i) $P$ is prime, and (ii) For any ideals $I,J \in R$, if $IJ \subseteq P$ then $I \subseteq P$ or $J \subseteq P$.
#### My Solution:
(i) $\implies$ ii

Let $IJ \subseteq P$ and suppose WLOG that $J \nsubseteq P$. Then there is some $b \in J$ such that $b \notin P$. But then $aRb \subseteq P$ for all $a \in I$, so by (i), $a \in P$ for all $a \in I$.

(ii) $\implies$ i

Let $IJ \subseteq P$ so that $I \subseteq P$ or $J \subseteq P$. Then if we let $a \in I$ and $b \in J$, if $aRb \subseteq P$, then $RaRb \subseteq P$, so by (ii), $a \in P$ or $b \in P$ which implies by definition that $P$ is prime.



### Determine the Galois group of $f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 +6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. 
#### My Solution:
Recall that the Galois group of a separable polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is defined to be the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$.

Well, $f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 +6 = (x^2-2)(x^2-3)$. We cannot factor $f(x)$ any futher in $\mathbb{Q}$ but in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, i)$, $f(x)$ can be factored into linear factors. So the plitting field over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, i)$. So the Galois group is $\mathrm{Aut} (\frac{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, i)}{\mathbb{Q}})$. QED

### Let $H \leq G$. Prove that $N_G(H)/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $Aut(H)$. Recall the normalizer $N_G(H) = \{g \in G | gHg^{-1} = H\}$ and the centralizer $C_G(H) = \{g \in G | gh = hg, \forall h \in H\}$
#### My Solution:
For $g \in N_G(H)$, it is clear that $\sigma_g:h \rightarrow ghg^{-1}$ defines an automorphism of $H$. Define a map:
$$ \sigma : N_G(H) \rightarrow Aut(H)$$
where $g \rightarrow \sigma_g$. Since for all $a,b \in N_G(H), h \in H$, we have that $\sigma_a \sigma_b (h) = abhb^{-1} a^{-1} = \sigma_{ab}(h)$. Then $\sigma$ is a group homomorphism from $N_G(H)$ to $Aut(H)$. Note that
$$\mathrm{Ker}(\sigma) = \{g \in N_G(H) | ghg^{-1} = h, \forall h \in H\}$$
$$ = C_G(H) \cap N_G(H) = C_G(H)$$
From the first isomorphism theorem we then have that $N_G(H)/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $Aut(H)$. QED



### An integral domain $D$ is said to be **Artinian** if for any descending chain of ideals $$I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq ...$$ of $D$, there is an integer $n$ such that $I_i - I_n$ for all $i \geq n$. Prove that an integral domain $D$ is Artinian if and only if it is a field.
#### My Solution:
Assume $D$  is Artinian, and has a unit $1_D$ that is a multiplicative identity element. For any $0 \neq a \in D$, consider the principle ideal generated by $a^i$, $(a^i)$. Since $a^{n+1}d=a^n (ad)$ for any $d \in D$, we have that $(a^{n+1}) \subseteq (a^n)$. Thus we have our descending chain of ideals
$$(a) \supseteq (a^2) \supseteq ... \supseteq (a^n) \supseteq ...$$
which will stabilize because $D$ is Artinian. Thus for some positive integer $m$, $$(a^m)=(a^{m+1})$$
Then since $a^m = a^m 1_D \in (a^m)$, there exists $s \in D$ such that $a^{m+1} s = a^m$ or $a^m (1_D - a s)=0$.
Using the properties of an integral domain, this implies that $as=1_D$. Thus we have shown that every $0 \neq a \in D$ has a multiplicative inverse thus $D$ is also a field.

Assume $D$ is an integral domain and a field. Then $D$ has only two ideals, the trivial and $D$ itself. Thus every strictly descending chain of ideals is of finite length, implying that $D$ is Artinian. QED



### A *principal ideal ring* is a ring in which every ideal has a single generator. (a) Prove that an element of a principal ideal domain is prime iff it is irreducible. (b) Provide an example of a principal ideal ring containing an element which is prime but not irreducible.
#### My Solution:
(a)
Recall that a PID is also an integral domain. Also recall that an integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. Also an element in an integral domain is irreducible if it is not equal to the product of two non-units. Also recall that if $R$ is our integral domain, $u \in R$ is a unit if for some $v \in R$, $uv = e$ where $e$ is the identity in $R$. Lastly, recall that $p \in R$ is prime if $p|ab \implies p|a$ or $p|b$. 

Let $p \in R$ be a prime element where $R$ is an integral domain. Assume $p = ab$ where $a,b \in R$. Obviously $p|ab$, so because $p$ is prime, $p|a$ or $p|b$. WLOG, assume $p|a$ such that $px = a$ for some $x \in R$. If $1$ is the identity of $R$, then 
$$1*a=a=px=(ab)x=a(bx)$$
Because $R$ is an integral domain, $a$ can be cancelled out implying that $1=bx$, thus $b$ is a unit. This proves that $p$ is also irreducible in an integral domain. 

Now assume that $p$ is irrecucible. To complete the proof, we want to show that $p$ is prime. If $p$ is irreducible, then $(p)$ is maximal in the set of all proper principal ideals of $R$. Since $R$ is a principal ideal domain then every ideal is principal, so in fact $(p)$ is maximal in $R$ itself. Since $R$ is an integral domain (because it's a PID), then $R$ has an identity. So then $(p)$ must be prime which implies $p$ must then be prime. QED

## Important proofs (not specific to Qualifiers)




### Prove the First Isomorphism Theorem for Groups
#### My Solution
First we will state the theorem itself:

Let $\phi : G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism of groups, then $\mathrm{ker} \phi \unlhd G$ and $\frac{G}{\mathrm{ker}\phi} \cong \phi(G)$.

To shorten things, let $K = \mathrm{ker}\phi$. Define the homomorphism $\psi : G/K \rightarrow \phi(G)$ by $\psi(Kg) = \phi(g)$. We claim that $\psi$ is an isomorphism. So we need to check that it's a well-defined homomorphism, and a bijection. First, to check that it's well-defined, we will check to see that if $a \in Kg$, then $\phi(a) = \phi(g)$. If we let $a = kg$ then for some $k \in K$, then 
$$\phi(a) = \phi(kg) = \phi(k)\phi(g) = \phi(g)$$
Now we will show that $\psi$ is a homomorphism. Consider $Kg, Kh \in G/K$. Then for any $a,b \in K$ we have that
$$\psi(Kg*Kh) = \psi(Kgh) =\phi(gh) = \phi(g) \phi(h) = \psi(Kg) \psi(Kh)$$
This proves that $\psi$ is a well-defined homomorphism. To prove that $\psi$ is one-to-one, we must prove that $\mathrm{ker}(\psi) = K$. Well, observe that 
$$\psi(Kg) = 1 \iff \phi(g) = 1 \iff g \in \mathrm{ker}(\phi) \iff g \in K \iff Kg = K$$
So $\mathrm{ker}(\psi) = K$. Finally we just need that $\psi$ is onto, which is somewhat obvious from the fact that $\phi(g) \in \phi(G)$ so that $\phi(g)$ has preimage $Kg$. Thus we have proven the First Isomorphism Theorem for Groups. QED



### Prove the 2nd Isomorphism Theorem for Groups
#### My Solution:

First we must state it. Let $G$ be an arbitrary group. For any two subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $G$, define $HK = \{ hk | h \in H, k \in K\}$. Assume $H \unlhd G$ and $K \leq G$. Then: (a) $HK \leq G$. (b) $H \unlhd HK$ and $(H \cap K) \unlhd K$. (c) $\frac{HK}{H} \cong \frac{K}{H \cap K}$.

(a) Recall that $HK$ can only be a subgroup if $HK = KH$. Thus if $H \unlhd G$, and we let $h \in H$ and $k \in K$, by assumption $khk^{-1} \in H$. Thus
$$kh = (khk^{-1})k \in HK$$ 
This proves that $KH \subseteq HK$. Similarly, $hk = k(k^{-1}hk) \in KH$ which proves the reverse containment. Thus $HK \leq G$. QED

(b) Since $K$ normalizes $H$ and $H$ normalizes itself trivially, this implies that $HK$ normalizes $H$. Thus $H \unlhd HK$. Since $H \unlhd HK$, the quotient group $\frac{HK}{H}$ is well defined. Define the map $\Gamma : K \rightarrow \frac{HK}{H}$ by $\Gamma (k) = kH$. Since the group operation in $\frac{HK}{H}$ is well defined, it's easy to see that $\Gamma$ is a homomorphism:
$$\Gamma(k_1 k_2) = (k_1 k_2)H = k_1 H *k_2 H = \Gamma(k_1) \Gamma(k_2)$$
Alternatively, the map $\Gamma$ is just the restriction to the subgroup $K$ of the natural progression homomorphism $\pi : HK \rightarrow \frac{HK}{H}$, so it's also a homomorphism. It is clear then from the definition of $HK$ that $\Gamma$ is onto. The identity of $\frac{HK}{H}$ is simply $H$, so the kernel of $\Gamma$ consists of the elements $k \in K$ with $kH = H$, or where $k \in H$. Thus $\mathrm{ker}\Gamma = H \cap K$. So by the first isomorphism theorem, $H \cap K \unlhd K$. QED

(c) Following the proof of part (b), by the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\frac{HK}{H} \cong \frac{K}{H \cap K}$ QED



### State and Prove the 3rd Isomorphism Theorem for Groups
#### My Solution:
First (once again) we must state it first. Let $K,N \unlhd G$ with $N \leq K$. Then $K/N \unlhd G/N$ and $(G/N)/(K/N) \cong G/K$.

The proof that $K/N \unlhd G/N$ is easy and follows from the 4th Isomorphism Theorem for Groups, so we will leave this aside. Now, define
$$\phi: G/N \rightarrow G/K$$
by $\phi(Ng) = Kg$. By the First Isomorphism Theroem, $(G/N)/\mathrm{ker}(\phi) \cong \phi(G)$. It is clear that $\phi$ is onto, so $\phi(G) = G/K$. Now
$$\mathrm{ker}(\phi) = \{Ng \in G/N | Kg = K\} = \{Ng \in G/N | g \in K\} = K/N$$
Thus by the First Isomorphism Theorem, $(G/N)/(K/N) \cong G/K$. QED



### State and Prove the 1st Isomorphism Theorem for Rings
#### My Solution:
If $\phi: R \rightarrow S$ is a homomorphism of rings, then the kernel of $\phi$ is an ideal of $R$, the image of $\phi$ is a subring of $S$, and $R/\mathrm{ker}(\phi) \cong \phi(R)$

Proof: 

If $I$ is the kernel of $\phi$, then the cosets of $I$ are precisely the fibers of $\phi$. In particular, the cosets $r+I,s+I,$ and $rs+I$ are the fibers of $\phi$ over $\phi(r), \phi(s),$ and $\phi(rs)$ respectively. Since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism, $\phi(r) \phi(s) = \phi(rs)$, hence $(r+I)(s+I) = rs+I$. Multiplication of cosets is well defined and so $I$ is an ideal and $R/I$ is a ring. The correspondence $R+I \rightarrow \phi(r)$ is a bijection between rings $R/I$ and $\phi(R)$ which respects addition and multiplication, hence is a ring isomorphism. Proving that the image of $\phi$ is a subring of $S$ is trivial. QED 



### State and Prove the 2nd Isomorphism Theorem for Rings
#### My Solution:
Let $A$ be a subgring and let $B$ be an ideal of $R$. Then $A+B = \{a+b| a \in A, b \in B\}$ is a subring of $R$, $A \cap B$ is an ideal of $A$ and $\frac{(A+B)}{B} \cong \frac{A}{(A \cap B)}$

Proof:

(a)
$A$ is a subring and $B$ is an ideal, so $1+0 \in A+B$. Let $a_1 + b_1$ and $a_2 + b_2$ be elements of $A+B$. Then
$$(a_1+b_1) - (a_2+b_2) = (a_1-a_2)+(b_1-b_2)$$
and
$$(a_1+b_1)(a_2+b_2) = a_1a_2+a_1b_2+b_1a_2+b_1b_2$$
Hence $A+B$ is a subring of $R$.

(b)
The intersection $A \cap B$ is nonempty since $0$ is contained in $A$ and $B$. Let $b_1,b_2 \in A \cap B$ and let $a \in A$. Then $b_1+b_2 \in A \cap B$ sinc $A$ and $B$ are both closed under addition. Furthermore $ab_1$ and $ab_2$ are in $A \cap B$ since $B$ is closed under multiplication from $R \supset A$ and $A$ is closed under multiplication. Thus $A \cap B$ is an ideal of $A$.

(c)
Consider the map $\phi: A \rightarrow (A+B)/B$ which sends an element $a$ to $a+B$. THis is a ring homomorphism by definition of addition and multiplication in quotient rings (easy to prove). We claim that it is onto with kernel $A \cap B$ whcih would complete the proof by the first isomorphism theorem for rings. Consider the elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Then $a + b + B = a +B$ since $b \in B$, so $a+b+B \in \mathrm{im} \phi$ and hence $\phi$ is onto. Let $a \in A$ be an element of $\mathrm{ker}(\phi)$. THen $a+B =B$ which holds iff $a \in B$ or equivalently if $a \in A \cap B$. Thus $\mathrm{ker}(\phi) = A \cap B$ and by the first isomorphism theorem we have our result. QED



### State and Prove the 3rd Isomorphism Theroem for Rings
#### My Solution:
Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of $R$ with $J \subseteq I$. Then $\frac{I}{J}$ is an ideal of $\frac{R}{J}$ and $\frac{(R/J)}{(I/J)} \cong \frac{R}{I}$.

Proof:

Since $I$ and $J$ are ideals, they are nonempty and so $I/J = \{a+J|a \in I\}$ is also nonempty. Let $a_1,a_2 \in I$ and let $r \in R$. By definition of addition and multiplication of cosets, we have
$$(a_1+J)+(a_2+J)=(a_1+a_2)+J$$
$$(r+J)(a_1+J)=ra_1+J$$
and
$$(a_1+J)(r+J)=a_1r+J$$
Since $I$ is an ideal, $a_1+a_2,ra_1,$ and $a_1r$ are contained in$I$ so $I/J$ is an ideal of $R/J$. Consider the map $\phi:R/J \rightarrow R/I$ that sends $r+J$ to $r+I$. We claim that this is a well-defined onto homomorphism with kernel equal to $I/J$. This is fairly obvious to see as every input has an image in $R/I$. As for the kernel, take any $a+J \in I/J$ where $a \in I$. Well, $a+J \in R/J$ as well, and maps to $a+I = I$ because $a \in I$. Thus $I/J$ is the kernel. Thus we have proven the desired result by the first isomorphism theorem for rings. QED

- A group $G$ is *solvable* if there is a chain of subgroups $1 = G_0 \unlhd G_1 \unlhd G_2 \unlhd ... \unlhd G_s = G$ such that $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian for all $i$.

- The permutation $\sigma$ is odd iff the number of cycles of even length in its cycle decomposition is odd. 

- A group action is *faithful* if its kernel is the identity.

- (Cayley's Theorem) Every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group. If $G$ is a group of order $n$, then $g$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$.

- If $G$ is a finite group of order $N$ and $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $|G|$, then any subgroup of index $p$ is normal.

- Two elements $a$ and $b$ of $G$ are said to be *conjugate* in $G$ is there is some $g \in G$ such that $b = gag^{-1}$. The orbits of $G$ acting on itself by conjugation are called the *conjugacy classes* of $G$.

- (The Class Equation) $|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i=1}^{r}|G:C_G(g_i)|$.

- Let $G$ be a group. An isomorphism from $G$ onto itself is called an *automorphism* of $G$.

- Let $G$ be a group and let $g \in G$. Conjugation by $g$ is called an *inner automorphism* of $G$ and the subgroup of $Aut(G)$ consisting of all inner automorphisms is denoted by $Inn(G)$.

- A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called *characteristic* in $G$ if every automorphism of $G$ maps $H$ to itself.

- (Sylow's Theorem) Let $G$ be a group of order $p^\alpha m$ where $p$ is a prime not dividing $m$. Then: (i) Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ exist, (ii) If $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and $Q$ is any $p$-subgroup of $G$, then there exists $g \in G$ such that $Q \leq gPg^{-1}$, in particular two Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are conjugate in $G$, and (iii) The number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ is of the form $1+kp$, or $n_p \equiv 1(mod (p))$.

- If $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, then the following are equivalent: $P$ is characteristic in $G$; $P$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ ($n_p =1$); $P$ is normal in $G$.

- A *maximal subgroup* of a group $G$ is a proper subgroup $M$ of $G$ such that there are no subgroups $H$ of $G$ with $M \leq H \leq G$.



### Ring Theory

- A *ring* $R$ is a set together with two binary operations $+$ and $\times$ satisfying the following properties:

-- $(R, +)$ is an abelian group

-- $\times$ is associative

-- The distributive law holds for $R$

- A ring $R$ is commutative if multiplication is commutative.

- The ring $R$ is said to have an *identity* if there is an element $1 \in R$ such that $1a = a1 = a$ for all $a \in R$.

- A ring $R$ with $1$ is called a *division ring* if every nonzero element $a \in R$ has a multiplicative inverse. A commutative division ring is called a *field*.

- Let $R$ be a ring. A nonzero element of $a \in R$ is called a *zero divisor* if there is a nonzero element $b \in R$ such that either $ab =0$ or $ba=0$. 

- Assume $R$ has an identity $1 \neq 0$. An element $u$ of $R$ is called a *unit* in $R$ if there is some $v$ in $R$ such that $uv = vu = 1$.

- A commutative ring with identity $1 \neq 0$ is called an *integral domain* if it has no zero divisors. 

- A subring of the ring $R$ is a subgroup of $R$ that is closed under multiplication.

- Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. A *ring homomorphism* is a map $\phi : R \rightarrow S$ satisfying:

(a) $\phi(a+b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b)$ for all $a,b \in R$

(b) $\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \phi(b)$ for all $a,b \in R$.

- The *kernel* of the ring homomorphism $\phi$ is the set of elements of $R$ that map to $0$ in $S$. 

- A bijective ring homomorphism is a *ring isomorphism*.

- Let $R$ and $S$ be rings and let $\phi: R \rightarrow S$ be a homomorphism. Then the image of $\phi$ is a subgring of $S$. Also, the kernel of $\phi$ is a subring of $R$.

- Let $R$ be a ring and let $I$ be a subset of $R$, and let $ r \in R$. $rI = \{ra | a \in I\}$ and $Ir = \{ar | a \in I\}$. A subset $I$ of $R$ is a *left ideal* of $R$ if $I$ is a subring and $I$ is closed under left multiplication by elements from $R$, ie. $rI \subseteq I$ for all $r \in R$. A right ideal is identical to this, just replace left with right. Then an *ideal* is a subset $I$ of $R$ that is both a left and a right ideal. 

- Let $a \in R$. $(a)$ is the ideal generated by $a$.

- Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. $I = R$ iff $I$ contains a unit. Assume $R$ is commutative. Then $R$ is a field iff its only ideals are $0$ and $R$.

- An ideal $M$ in a ring $R$ is a *maximal ideal* if $M \neq R$ and the only ideals containing $M$ are $M$ and $R$.

- Assume $R$ is commutative. The ideal $M$ is a maximal ideal iff the quotient ring $R/M$ is a field. 

- Assume $R$ is commutative. An ideal $P$ is called a *prime ideal* if $P \neq R$ and whenever the product $ab$ of two elements $a,b \in R$ is an element of $P$, then at least one of $a$ and $B$ is an element of $P$.

- Any function $N: R \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{+} \cup \{0\}$ with $N(0) =0$ is called a *norm* on the integral domain $R$. If $N(a) >0$ for $a \neq 0$ define $N$ to be a *positive norm*.

- The integral domain $R$ is said to be a *Euclidean Domain* if there is a norm $N$ on $R$ such that for any two elements $a$ and $b$ of $R$ with $b \neq 0$ there exists elements $q$ and $r$ in $R$ such that 
$$a = qb+r | r = 0 \lor N(r) < N(b)$$

- A *Principle Ideal Domain* or *PID* is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.

- Every nonzero prime ideal in a PID is a maximal ideal.

- If $R$ is any commutative ring such that the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is a PID (or a Euclidean Domain), then $R$ is necessarily a field.

- Let $R$ be an integral domain. Suppose $r \in R$ is nonzero and is not a unit. Then $r$ is called *irreducible* in $R$ if whenever $r=ab$ with $a,b \in R$, at least one of $a$ or $b$ must be a unit in $R$. Otherwise $r$ is *reducible.

- Let $R$ be an integral domain. The nonzero element $p \in R$ is called *prime* in $R$ if the ideal $(p)$ generated by $p$ is a prime ideal. In other words, a nonzero element $p$ isa prime if it is not a unit and whenever $p | ab$ for any $a,b \in R$, then either $p|a$ or $p|b$.

- Let $R$ be an integral domain. Two elements $a$ and $b$ of $R$ differing by a unit are said to be *associate* in $R$.

- In an integral domain a prime element is always irreducible.

- In a PID a nonzero element is a prime iff it is irreducible.

- A *Unique Factorization Domain* or *UFD* is an integral domain $R$ in which every nonzero element $r \in R$ which is not a unit has the following two proporties: (i) $r$ can be written as a finite product of irreducibles $p_i$ of $R$ (not necessarily distinct), so $r = p_1p_2...p_n$; and (ii) the decomposition in (i) is *unique up to associates*, namely, if $r = q_1q_2...q_m$ is another factorization of $r$ into irreducibles, then $m =n$ and there is some renumbering of the factors so that $p_i$ is associate to $q_i$ for all $i$.

- In a UFD a nonzero element is a prime iff it's irreducible.

- The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are a UFD

- finite fields $\subset$ fields $\subset$ Euclidean domains $\subset$ PIDs $\subset$ UFDs $\subset$ integral domains $\subset$ commutative rings

- If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a PID and a UFD.

- (Gauss' Lemma) Let $R$ be a UFD with field of fractions $F$ and let $p(x) \in R[x]$. If $p(x)$ is reducible in $F[x]$ then $p(x)$ is reducible in $R[x]$. 

- $R$ is a UFD iff $R[x]$ is a UFD.

- Let $F$ be a field and let $p(x) \in F[x]$. Then $p(x)$ has a factor of degree one iff $p(x)$ has a root in $F$.

- (Eisenstein's Criterion) Let $P$ be a prime ideal of the integral domain $R$ and let $f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0$ be a polynomial in $R[x]$. Suppose $a_{n-1},...,a_1,a_0$ are all elements of $P$ and suppose $a_0$ is not an element of $P^2$. Then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$.



### Field and Galois Theory

- Let $F \subseteq K \subseteq L$ be fields. Then
$$[L:F] = [L:K][K:F]$$

- The *characteristic* of a field $F$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer $p$ such that $p*1_F = 0$ if such a $p$ exists and is defined to be $0$ otherwise.

- The *prime subfield* of a field $F$ is the subfield of $F$ generated by the multiplicative identity $1_F$ of $F$. 

- If $K$ is a field containing the subfield $F$, then $K$ is said to be an *extension field* of $F$, denoted $K/F$.

- Let $K$ be an extension of the field $F$ and let $\alpha, \beta,... \in K$ be a collection of elements in $K$. Then the smallest subfield of $K$ containing both $F$ and the elements $\alpha, \beta,...$, denoted $F(\alpha, \beta,...)$ is called the field *generated* by $\alpha, \beta,...$ over $F$.

- If the field $K$ is generated by a single element $\alpha$ over $F$, $K = F(\alpha)$, then $K$ is said to be a *simple* extension of $F$ and the element $\alpha$ is called a *primitive element* for the extension.

- The element $\alpha \in K$ is said to be *algebraic* over $F$ if $\alpha$ is a root of some nonzero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$. If $\alpha$ is not algebraic over $F$ then $\alpha$ is said to be *transcendental* over $F$. The extension $K/F$ is said to be *algebraic* if every element of $K$ is algebraic over $F$.

- Let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $F$. Then there is a unique monic irreducible polynomial $m_{\alpha, F}(x) \in F[x]$ which has $\alpha$ as a root. A polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ has $\alpha$ as a root iff $m_{\alpha, F}(x)$ divides $f(x)$ in $F[x]$.

- The element $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ iff the simple extension $F(\alpha)/F$ is finite.

- If the extension $K/F$ is finite, then it's algebraic.

- Let $L/F$ be an arbitrary extension. Then the collection of elements of $L$ that are algebraic over $F$ form a subfield $K$ of $L$.

- If $K$ is algebraic over $F$ and $L$ is algebraic over $K$, then $L$ is algebraic over $F$.

- THe extension field $K$ of $K$ is called a *splitting field* for the polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ if $f(x)$ factors completely into linear factors in $K[x]$ and $f(x)$ does not factor completely into linear factors over any proper subfield of $K$ containing $F$.

- For any field $F$, if $f(x) \in F[x]$ then there exists an extension $K$ of $F$ which is a splitting field for $f(x)$.

- If $K$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ which is the splitting field over $F$ for a collection of polynomials $f(x) \in F[x]$ then $K$ is called a *normal* extension of $F$.

- (Uniqueness of Splitting Fields) Any two splitting fields for a polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ over a field $F$ are isomorphic.

- A field $K$ is said to be *algebraically closed* if every polynomial with coefficients in $K$ has a root in $K$. 

- (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) The field $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed.

$$(a+b)^p = a^p + b^p_{}\mathrm{and} (ab)^p = a^p b^p$$

- Suppose that $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field of characteristic $p$. Then every element of $\mathbb{F}$ is a $p$th power in $\mathbb{F}$.

- If $H$ is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of $K$, the subfield of $K$ fixed by all the elements of $H$ is called the *fixed field* of $H$.

- Let $K/F$ be a finite extension. Then $K$ is said to be *Galois* over $F$ and $K/F$ is a *Galois* extension if $|Aut(K/F)| = [K:F]$. If $K/F$ is Galois the group of automorphisms $Aut(K/F)$ is called the *Galois Group* of $K/F$, denoted $Gal(K/F)$.

- If $K$ is the splitting field over $F$ of a separable polynomial $f(x)$ then $K/F$ is Galois.

- If $f(x)$ is a separable polynomial over $F$, then the *Galois group of* $f(x)$ over $F$ is the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$.

- Let $G= \{\sigma_1 = 1, \sigma_2,...,\sigma_n\}$ be a subgroup of automorphisms of a field $K$ and let $F$ be the fixed field. Then $[K:F] = n = |G|$.

- The extension $K/F$ is Galois iff $K$ is the splitting field of some separable polynomial over $F$.

- (Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory) Let $K/F$ be a Galois extension and set $G=Gal(K/F)$. Then there is an order reversing bijection between the subfields of $K$ containing $F$ and the subgroups of $G$. Theorem continues, but this is biggest idea.
