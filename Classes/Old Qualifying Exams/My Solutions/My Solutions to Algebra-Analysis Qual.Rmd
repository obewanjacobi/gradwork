### Let $(G,·)$ be a group and $Z = Z(G)$ its center. Suppose that the group $G/Z$ is cyclic. Show that $G$ is Abelian.
#### My Solution:

Let $G/Z$ be cyclic with generator $xZ$. Every element in $G/Z$ can be written as $x^k Z$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z \in Z$. Now let $g,h \in G$. Then

$$g=x^a z$$ and $$h = x^b w$$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z,w \in Z$. 

Thus 
$$gh = x^a z x^b w = x^{a+b} zw = x^{b+a} wz = x^b w x^a z = hg$$
because $z,w \in Z$. THus $gh = hg$ which implies that G is Abelian. QED



### Prove that every prime ideal is maximal in a PID.
#### My Solution:

Let $P$ be a prime ideal in the PID $R$. So $ab \in P$ iff $a$ or $b \in P$. But $R$ is a PID, so $P =(a)$ where $a \in R$. So we want to show $P$ is maximal using this information, ie. if $I$ is an ideal that contains $P$, then $I=P$ or $I=R$. So let $I$ be an ideal containing $P$ such that $P \subset I \subset R$. Let $I =(b)$ where $B \in R$ because $R$ is a PID. Now, $a \in (a) \subset (b)$ which implies that there exists $c \in R$ such that $a =bc$. Since $a = bc \in P$, we know either $b$ or $c$ is in $P$ because it's prime. 

If $b \in P$, then $I = (b) \subset P$ which implies $P=I$. On the other hand, if $c \in P =(a)$, then there exists $d \in R$ such that $c = ad$. So $$a =bc =bad$$

Because $R$ is an integral domain (because it'e a PID), we can reduce the above formula to $$1 = bd$$

Thus $b$ is a unit which implies that $I = (b) = R$.

Thus either $P=I$ or $I=R$ for all $I$ containing $P$, so $P$ is maximal in $R$.  QED



### Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$. For any two ideals $I$ and $J$ of $R$, let $IJ$ be the ideal generated by all products $xy$ where $x \in I$ and $y\in J$. Suppose $I+J = R$, prove that $IJ = I \cap J$.

#### My Solution:

We will prove this using set containment.

Because $I$ and $J$ are ideals in $R$, for all $x_i \in I$ and all $y_i \in J$, $x_i y_i \in I$ and $x_i y_i \in J$. Moreover, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in I$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in J$. Thus 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in IJ$$
which implies
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \in I \cap J$$
Thus $IJ \subset I \cap J$

Now we just need to show that $IJ \supset I \cap J$. To do this we will use the fact that $I+J=R$. Let $a \in I \cap J$. We know $1 \in R = I + J$. So $1 = i + j$ for some $i \in I$ and $j \in J$. Then since $R$ is commutative, 
$$a = a 1 = a (i+j) = ai + aj = ia + aj$$
However $ia \in IJ$ since $i \in I$ and $a \in J$ and $aj \in IJ$ for similar reasons as our previous argument. By the definition of $IJ$, this shows us $a \in IJ$. Thus $I \cap J \subset IJ$.

Thus we've proven that $IJ = I \cap J$ in this circumstance. QED



### Prove that any finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $A_n$ for some $n$, where $A_n$ is the alternating group on $n$ elements.
#### My Solution:

To do this proof, we will use the broader proof of Cayley's Theorem. This theorem states that if $G$ is a group of order $n < \infty$, then $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$. Since $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$, this proof will be sufficient to show the desired result.

Let $S$ be the set of all elements of $G$. Now consider the action of $G$ on $S$,
$$G \times S \rightarrow S, a*b:=ab$$
This action defines a homomorphism $\gamma: G \rightarrow \mathrm{Perm}(S)$. It is fairly easy to see that this homomorphism is one-to-one and onto. Thus, it follows that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Perm}(S)$. And finally, since $|S| = n$ we have that $\mathrm{Perm}(S) \cong S_n$. QED












### Prove that for any prime $p$, the ﬁeld $\mathbb{F}_p$ with $p$ elements contains an element a such that $[\mathbb{F}_p( 3 \sqrt{a}) : \mathbb{F}_p] = 3$ if and only if $3$ divides $p−1$. (Hint: you may use the fact that for any ﬁnite ﬁeld $\mathbb{F}$, the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}$ * is cyclic.)

### Prove that a group of order $300$ cannot be simple.
#### My Solution:
To begin, we must understand what it means for a group to be simple. A simple group is a group of whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the entire group itself. Thus we want to show there are no proper normal subgroups other than the trivial group.

To do this we will use Sylow's Theorem and a proof by contradiction.

Let $G$ be a group of order $300$ such that $G$ is simple. Well, $300 = 3 \times 2^2 \times 5^2$. We will denote the number of Sylow-p subgroups as $n_p$. Notice then that $n_5 | 12$ and $n_5 = 1 + 5k$. This implies that $n_5 = 1$ or $6$. However, because $G$ is simple there cannot only be one Sylow-5 subgroup, otherwise we would have a proper nontrivial normal subgroup. Thus $n_5 = 6$. Because of this and because $G$ is simple, we can say that $G$ embeds into $S_6$ if we let $G$ act on the Sylow-5 subgroups by conjugation. But then by Lagrange's Theorem, $300$ should divide $6!$, which it does not. Thus we have a contradiction, which implies that $G$ is not simple, thus a group of order $300$ cannot be simple.

### Prove that if $f : [0,1] \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ is absolutely continuous, then so is $1/f$.

#### My Solution:

By the definition of absolutely continuous, we then know that on $[0,1]$ for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta$ such that 
$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} |f(b_i) - f(a_i)| < \epsilon$$
where ${(a_i,b_i)}$ is an infinite collection of disjoint intervals in $[0,1]$ with $\sum_{i=1}^{k} |b_i - a_i| < \delta$. Since this is true for $f$, we must shift our focus now to $1/f$.
