### Royden Chapter 1
- A nonepmty set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **bounded above** provided that there is a real number $b$ such that $x \leq b$ for all $x \in E$. $b$ is known as an upper bound for $E$. We define bounded below similarly.

- **The Completeness Axiom**: Let $E$ be a nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above. Then among the set of upper bounds for $E$ there is a smallest, or least, upper bound.

- The least upper bound of $E$ is called the **supremum** of $E$ and denoted by $\mathrm{sup}E$. We define the **infimum** similarly as the greatest lower bound and denote it by $\mathrm{inf}E$.

- **Triangle Inequality**: 
$$|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$$

- A set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **inductive** provided it contains $1$ and if the number $x \in E$, the number $x+1 \in E$ as well.

- Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a smallest member.

- **Archimedean Property**: For each pair of positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, there is a natural number $n$ for which $na > b$.

- A set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ provided between any two real numbers there lies a member of $E$.

- The rational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

- A set $E$ is said to be **finite** provided either it is empty or there is a natural number $n$ such that $E$ is equipotent to $\{1,2,3,...,n\}$. 

- We say that $E$ is **countably infinite** provided $E$ is equipotent to the set $\mathbb{N}$ (the natural numbers). A set that is either finite or countably finite is said to be **countable**. A set that is not countable is **uncountable**.

- A subset of a countable set is countable.

- A nonempty set is countable iff it is the image of a function whose domain is a nonempty countable set.

- The union of countable sets is countable.

- A set $\mathcal{O}$ of real numbers is called **open** provided for each $x \in \mathcal{O}$, there is a $r > 0$ for which the interval $(x-r, x+r)$ is contained in $\mathcal{O}$.

- The set of real numbers and the empty set are open; the intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open; and the union of any collection of open sets is open.

- Every nonempty open set is the disjoint union of a countable collection of open intervals.

- For a set $E$ of real numbers, a real number $x$ is called a **point of closure** of $E$ provided every open interval that contains $x$ also contains a point in $E$. The collection of points of closure of $E$ is called the **closure** of $E$.

- A set of real numbers is open iff its complement in $\mathbb{R}$ is closed.

- A collection of sets $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ is said to be a **cover** of a set $E$ provided $E \subseteq \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}$. By a subcover of a cover of $E$ we mean a subcollection of the cover that itself also is a cover of $E$. If each set $E_{\lambda}$ in a cover is open, then we call $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ an **open cover** of $E$. If the cover $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ contains only a finite number of sets, we call it a **finite cover**. 

- Let $F$ be a closed and bounded set of real numbers. THen every open cover of $F$ has a finite subcover.

- We say that a countable collection of sets $\{E_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ is **descending** or **nested** provided that $E_{n+1} \subseteq E_n$ for every natural number $n$. It is said to be **ascending** provided $E_n \subseteq E_{n+1}$ for every natural number $n$.

- **$\sigma$-algebra**: Given a set $x$, a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra provided

-- the empty set belongs to $\mathcal{A}$

-- the complement in $X$ of a set in $\mathcal{A}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{A}$

-- the union of a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.

- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of subsets of a set $X$. Then the intersection $\mathcal{A}$ of all $\sigma$-algebras of subsets of $X$ that contain $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains $\mathcal{F}$. Moreover, it is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of subsets $X$ that contains $\mathcal{F}$ in the sense that any $\sigma$-algebra that contains $\mathcal{F}$ also contains $\mathcal{A}$.

- The collection $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets of real numbers is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of sets of real numbers that contains all of the open sets of real numbers. (every open set is a Borel set)


### Royden Chapter 2

- **The measure of an interval is its length**. Each nonempty interval $I$ is Lebesgue measurable and $$m(I) = l(I)$$

- **Measure is translation invariant**. If $E$ is Lebesgue measurable and $y$ is any number, then the translate of $E$ by $y$, $E+y = \{x+y|x \in E\}$, also is Lebesgue measurable and $$m(E+y) = m(E)$$

- **Measure is countably additive over countable disjoint unions of sets**. If $\{E_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is a countable disjoint collection of Lebesgue measurable sets, then 
$$m \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k \right) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k)$$

- The **outer measure** of an interval is its length, it is translation invariant, however the outer measure is not finitely additive. Instead:
$$m^* \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k \right) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m^*(E_k)$$

- Let $I$ be a nonempty interval of real numbers. For a set $A$ of real numbers, consider the countable collections $\{I_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ of nonempty open, bounded intervals that cover $A$, that is, collections for which $A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_k$. We define the **outer measure** of $A$, $m^*(A)$, to be
$$m^*(A) = \mathrm{inf}\{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}l(I_k) | A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_k\}$$

- A measure is **monotone** if for all $A \subseteq B$, then $m^*(A) \leq m^*(B)$.

- A set $E$ is said to be **measurable** provided for any set $A$ that
$$m^*(A) = m^*(A \cap E) + m^*(A \cap E^C)$$

- Any set of outer measure zero is measurable. In particular, any countable set is measurable.

- The union of a finite collection of measurable sets is measurable.

- The union of a countable collection of measurable sets is measurable.

- Every interval is measurable.

- The collection $\mathcal{M}$ of measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets. Each interval, each open set, each closed set, and each clopen set is measurable.

- The translate of a measurable set is measurable.

- If $A$ is a measurable set of finite outer measure that is contained in $B$, then
$$m^*(B/A) = m^*(B) - m^*(A)$$ and $$m^*(B) = m^*(A) + m^*(B/A)$$ 

- The restriction of the set function outer measure to the class of measurable sets is called **Lebesgue Measure**. It is denoted by $m$, so that if $E$ is a measurable set, its Lebesgue measure will be $m(E)$, defined by
$$m(E) = m^*(E)$$

- The Lebesgue measure defined on the $\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets assigns length to any interval, is translation invariant, and is countably additive.

- **The Continuity of Measure**: Lebesgue measure possesses the following continuity properties:

(a) If $\{A_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is an ascending collection of measurable sets, then,
$$m \left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}A_k \right) = \lim_{k\to\infty} m(A_k)$$

(b) If $\{B_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is a descending collection of measurable sets and $m(B_1) < \infty$, then $$m \left( \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}B_k \right) = \lim_{k\to\infty} m(B_k)$$

- For a measurable set $E$, we say that a property holds **almost everywhere** on $E$, or it holds for almost all $x \in E$, provided there is a subset $E_0$ of $E$ for which $m(E_0) = 0$ and the property holds for all $x \in E$ ~ $E_0$.

- Let $\{E_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ be a countable collection of measurable sets for which $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k) < \infty$. Then almost all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ belong to at most finitely many of the $E_k$'s.

# My Solutions from Quals

### Prove that if $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue measure $0$, then $m(\{e^x | x \in A\}) = 0$.
#### My Solution:
Let $m(A) = 0$ and $E = \{\mathrm{e}^x|x \in A\}$. First note that we know $f(x) = \mathrm{e}^x$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A_N = [-N,N] \cap A$, then 
$$A = \bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty} A_N$$
Also, $m(A) = 0 \implies m(A_N) = 0$ for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$. By definition of Lebesgue measure, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a sequence of intervals $\{I_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ such that $I_i \cap I_j$ is the empty set for all $i$ and $j$. Also, $A_N \subset \cup I_n$ such that $\sum_n l(I_n) < \epsilon$ since $m(A_N) = 0$. Let $I_n = (a_n,b_n)$, $I_n^* = [a_n,b_n]$, then $m(I_n) = m(I_n^*)$. Then 
$$m(f(A_N)) < \sum_n m(f(I_n)) = \sum_n m(f(I_n^*))$$
Since $f$ is continuous, we know that $m(f(I_n^*)) = \max_{x \in I_n^*} f(x) - \min_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$. Since $I_n^*$ is a closed interval and $f$ is continuous, we can find $x_1$ and $x_2 \in I_n^*$ such that $f(x_1) = \max_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$ and $f(x_2) = \min_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$. WLOG we can assume that $x_1 \leq x_2$. Then, 
$$m(f(I_n^*)) = f(x_1) - f(x_2) \leq |f'(\alpha)|(x_1-x_2) $$
$$\leq \max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) \times l(I_n) \leq \max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) \epsilon$$
where $\alpha \in (x_1,x_2)$

Since $\max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) < \infty$ and $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we find that $m(f(I_n)) = 0$. This implies $m(f(A_N)) = 0$ which implies 
$$m(f(A)) = m(f(\cup^{\infty}_N A_N)) \leq \sum_{N}^{\infty} m(f(A_N)) = 0$$
Thus, $m(f(A)) = m(E) = 0$. QED
