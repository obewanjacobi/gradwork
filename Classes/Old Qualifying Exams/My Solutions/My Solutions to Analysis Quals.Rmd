# My Solutions from Quals

## Spring 2017

### Prove that if $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue measure $0$, then $m(\{e^x | x \in A\}) = 0$.
#### My Solution:
Let $m(A) = 0$ and $E = \{\mathrm{e}^x|x \in A\}$. First note that we know $f(x) = \mathrm{e}^x$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A_N = [-N,N] \cap A$, then 
$$A = \bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty} A_N$$
Also, $m(A) = 0 \implies m(A_N) = 0$ for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$. By definition of Lebesgue measure, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a sequence of intervals $\{I_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ such that $I_i \cap I_j$ is the empty set for all $i$ and $j$. Also, $A_N \subset \cup I_n$ such that $\sum_n l(I_n) < \epsilon$ since $m(A_N) = 0$. Let $I_n = (a_n,b_n)$, $I_n^* = [a_n,b_n]$, then $m(I_n) = m(I_n^*)$. Then 
$$m(f(A_N)) < \sum_n m(f(I_n)) = \sum_n m(f(I_n^*))$$
Since $f$ is continuous, we know that $m(f(I_n^*)) = \max_{x \in I_n^*} f(x) - \min_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$. Since $I_n^*$ is a closed interval and $f$ is continuous, we can find $x_1$ and $x_2 \in I_n^*$ such that $f(x_1) = \max_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$ and $f(x_2) = \min_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$. WLOG we can assume that $x_1 \leq x_2$. Then, 
$$m(f(I_n^*)) = f(x_1) - f(x_2) \leq |f'(\alpha)|(x_1-x_2) $$
$$\leq \max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) \times l(I_n) \leq \max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) \epsilon$$
where $\alpha \in (x_1,x_2)$

Since $\max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) < \infty$ and $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we find that $m(f(I_n)) = 0$. This implies $m(f(A_N)) = 0$ which implies 
$$m(f(A)) = m(f(\cup^{\infty}_N A_N)) \leq \sum_{N}^{\infty} m(f(A_N)) = 0$$
Thus, $m(f(A)) = m(E) = 0$. QED

## Graduate Notes/Royden Book

### Royden Chapter 1 (Sets, Sequences, and Functions)
- A nonepmty set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **bounded above** provided that there is a real number $b$ such that $x \leq b$ for all $x \in E$. $b$ is known as an upper bound for $E$. We define bounded below similarly.

- **The Completeness Axiom**: Let $E$ be a nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above. Then among the set of upper bounds for $E$ there is a smallest, or least, upper bound.

- The least upper bound of $E$ is called the **supremum** of $E$ and denoted by $\mathrm{sup}E$. We define the **infimum** similarly as the greatest lower bound and denote it by $\mathrm{inf}E$.

- **Triangle Inequality**: 
$$|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$$

- A set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **inductive** provided it contains $1$ and if the number $x \in E$, the number $x+1 \in E$ as well.

- Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a smallest member.

- **Archimedean Property**: For each pair of positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, there is a natural number $n$ for which $na > b$.

- A set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ provided between any two real numbers there lies a member of $E$.

- The rational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

- A set $E$ is said to be **finite** provided either it is empty or there is a natural number $n$ such that $E$ is equipotent to $\{1,2,3,...,n\}$. 

- We say that $E$ is **countably infinite** provided $E$ is equipotent to the set $\mathbb{N}$ (the natural numbers). A set that is either finite or countably finite is said to be **countable**. A set that is not countable is **uncountable**.

- A subset of a countable set is countable.

- A nonempty set is countable iff it is the image of a function whose domain is a nonempty countable set.

- The union of countable sets is countable.

- A set $\mathcal{O}$ of real numbers is called **open** provided for each $x \in \mathcal{O}$, there is a $r > 0$ for which the interval $(x-r, x+r)$ is contained in $\mathcal{O}$.

- The set of real numbers and the empty set are open; the intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open; and the union of any collection of open sets is open.

- Every nonempty open set is the disjoint union of a countable collection of open intervals.

- For a set $E$ of real numbers, a real number $x$ is called a **point of closure** of $E$ provided every open interval that contains $x$ also contains a point in $E$. The collection of points of closure of $E$ is called the **closure** of $E$.

- A set of real numbers is open iff its complement in $\mathbb{R}$ is closed.

- A collection of sets $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ is said to be a **cover** of a set $E$ provided $E \subseteq \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}$. By a subcover of a cover of $E$ we mean a subcollection of the cover that itself also is a cover of $E$. If each set $E_{\lambda}$ in a cover is open, then we call $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ an **open cover** of $E$. If the cover $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ contains only a finite number of sets, we call it a **finite cover**. 

- Let $F$ be a closed and bounded set of real numbers. THen every open cover of $F$ has a finite subcover.

- We say that a countable collection of sets $\{E_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ is **descending** or **nested** provided that $E_{n+1} \subseteq E_n$ for every natural number $n$. It is said to be **ascending** provided $E_n \subseteq E_{n+1}$ for every natural number $n$.

- **$\sigma$-algebra**: Given a set $x$, a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra provided

-- the empty set belongs to $\mathcal{A}$

-- the complement in $X$ of a set in $\mathcal{A}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{A}$

-- the union of a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.

- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of subsets of a set $X$. Then the intersection $\mathcal{A}$ of all $\sigma$-algebras of subsets of $X$ that contain $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains $\mathcal{F}$. Moreover, it is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of subsets $X$ that contains $\mathcal{F}$ in the sense that any $\sigma$-algebra that contains $\mathcal{F}$ also contains $\mathcal{A}$.

- The collection $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets of real numbers is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of sets of real numbers that contains all of the open sets of real numbers. (every open set is a Borel set)


### Royden Chapter 2 (Lebesgue Measure)

- **The measure of an interval is its length**. Each nonempty interval $I$ is Lebesgue measurable and $$m(I) = l(I)$$

- **Measure is translation invariant**. If $E$ is Lebesgue measurable and $y$ is any number, then the translate of $E$ by $y$, $E+y = \{x+y|x \in E\}$, also is Lebesgue measurable and $$m(E+y) = m(E)$$

- **Measure is countably additive over countable disjoint unions of sets**. If $\{E_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is a countable disjoint collection of Lebesgue measurable sets, then 
$$m \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k \right) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k)$$

- The **outer measure** of an interval is its length, it is translation invariant, however the outer measure is not finitely additive. Instead:
$$m^* \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k \right) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m^*(E_k)$$

- Let $I$ be a nonempty interval of real numbers. For a set $A$ of real numbers, consider the countable collections $\{I_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ of nonempty open, bounded intervals that cover $A$, that is, collections for which $A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_k$. We define the **outer measure** of $A$, $m^*(A)$, to be
$$m^*(A) = \mathrm{inf}\{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}l(I_k) | A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_k\}$$

- A measure is **monotone** if for all $A \subseteq B$, then $m^*(A) \leq m^*(B)$.

- A set $E$ is said to be **measurable** provided for any set $A$ that
$$m^*(A) = m^*(A \cap E) + m^*(A \cap E^C)$$

- Any set of outer measure zero is measurable. In particular, any countable set is measurable.

- The union of a finite collection of measurable sets is measurable.

- The union of a countable collection of measurable sets is measurable.

- Every interval is measurable.

- The collection $\mathcal{M}$ of measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets. Each interval, each open set, each closed set, and each clopen set is measurable.

- The translate of a measurable set is measurable.

- If $A$ is a measurable set of finite outer measure that is contained in $B$, then
$$m^*(B/A) = m^*(B) - m^*(A)$$ and $$m^*(B) = m^*(A) + m^*(B/A)$$ 

- The restriction of the set function outer measure to the class of measurable sets is called **Lebesgue Measure**. It is denoted by $m$, so that if $E$ is a measurable set, its Lebesgue measure will be $m(E)$, defined by
$$m(E) = m^*(E)$$

- The Lebesgue measure defined on the $\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets assigns length to any interval, is translation invariant, and is countably additive.

- **The Continuity of Measure**: Lebesgue measure possesses the following continuity properties:

(a) If $\{A_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is an ascending collection of measurable sets, then,
$$m \left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}A_k \right) = \lim_{k\to\infty} m(A_k)$$

(b) If $\{B_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is a descending collection of measurable sets and $m(B_1) < \infty$, then $$m \left( \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}B_k \right) = \lim_{k\to\infty} m(B_k)$$

- For a measurable set $E$, we say that a property holds **almost everywhere** on $E$, or it holds for almost all $x \in E$, provided there is a subset $E_0$ of $E$ for which $m(E_0) = 0$ and the property holds for all $x \in E$ ~ $E_0$.

- Let $\{E_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ be a countable collection of measurable sets for which $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k) < \infty$. Then almost all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ belong to at most finitely many of the $E_k$'s.

- Let $E$ be a bounded measurable set of real numbers. Suppose there is a bounded, countably infinite set of real numbers $\Lambda$ for which the collection of translates of $E$, $\{\lambda + E\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$, is disjoint. Then $m(E) = 0$

- Any set $E$ of real numbers with positive outer measure contains a subset that fails to be measurable.

- There are disjoint sets of real numbers $A$ and $B$ for which
$$m^*(A \cup B) < m^* (A) + m^*(B)$$

- The Cantor set $C$ is a closed, uncountable set of measure zero

- The Cantor-Lebesgue function $\phi$ is an increasing continuous function that maps $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]$. Its derivative exists on the open set $\mathcal{O}$, the complement in $[0,1]$ of the Cantor set $\phi '=0$ on $\mathcal{O}$ while $m(\mathcal{O}) = 1$

- There is a measurable set, a subset of the Cantor set, that is not a Borel set.

### Royden Chapter 3 (Lebesgue Measurable Functions)

- Let the function $f$ have a measurable domain $E$. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(i) For all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{x \in E|f(x)  > c\}$ is measurable

(ii) For all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{x \in E|f(x)  \geq c\}$ is measurable

(iii) For all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{x \in E|f(x)  < c\}$ is measurable

(iv) For all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{x \in E|f(x)  \leq c\}$ is measurable

- An extended real-valued function $f$ defined on $E$ is said to be **Lebesgue measurable**, or simply **measurable**, provided its domain $E$ is measurable and it satisfies one of the four above statements.

- Let the function $f$ be defined on a measurable set $E$. Then $f$ is measurable iff for all open sets $\mathcal{O}$, the inverse image of $\mathcal{O}$ under $f$, $f^{-1}(\mathcal{O}) = \{x \in E| f(x) \in \mathcal{O}\}$, is measurable

- A real valued function that is continuous on its measurable domain is measurable

- A monotone function that is defined on an interval is measurable

- Let $f$ be an extended real-valued function $E$. Then if $f$ is measurable on $E$ and $f=g$ a.e. on $E$, then $g$ is measurable on $E$. For a measurable subset $D$ of $E$, $f$ is measurable on $E$ iff the restrictions of $f$ to $D$ and $E$~$D$ are measurable.

- Let $f$ and $g$ be measurable functions on $E$ that are finite a.e. on $E$. For any $\alpha$ and $\beta$, $\alpha f + \beta g$ is measurable on $E$ and $fg$ is measurable on $E$.

- Let $g$ be a measurable real-valued function defined on $E$ and $f$ a continuous real-valued function on all of $\mathbb{R}$. Then the composition $f \circ g$ is a measurable function on $E$

- For a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of functions with common domain $E$, a function $f$ on $E$ and a subset $A$ of $E$, we say that the sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges to $f$ pointwise on $A$ provided $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in A$; and the sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges to $f$ pointwise a.e. on $A$ provided it converges to $f$ pointwise on $A$~$B$ where $m(B) =0$; and the sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges to $f$ uniformly on $A$ provided for each $\epsilon >0$, there is an index $N$ for which $|f-f_n| < \epsilon$ on $A$ for all $n \geq N$.

- Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $E$ that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to the function $f$. Then $f$ is measurable.

- If $A$ is any set, the **characteristic function** of $A$, $\chi_A$, is the function on $\mathbb{R}$ defined by 
$$\chi_A = \{1|x \in A \& 0 |x \notin A \}$$

- A real-valued function $\phi$ defined on a measurable set $E$ is called **simple** provided it is measurable and takes only a finite number of values

- Let $f$ be a measurable real-valued function on $E$. Assume $f$ is bounded on $E$, that is there exists an $M \geq 0$ for which $|f| \leq M$ on $E$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0$, there are simple functions $\phi_{\epsilon}$ and $\psi_{\epsilon}$ defined on $E$ which have the following approximation properties on $E$:
$$\phi_{\epsilon} \leq f \leq \psi_{\epsilon}; 0 \leq \psi_{\epsilon} - \phi_{\epsilon} < \epsilon$$

- An extended real-valued function $f$ on a measurable set $E$ is measurable iff there is a sequence $\{\phi_n\}$ of simple functions on $E$ which converges pointwise on $E$ to $f$ and has the property that $|\phi_n| \leq |f|$ on $E$ for all $n$. If $f$ is nonnegative, we may choose $\{\phi_n\}$ to be increasing

- **Egoroff's Theorem**: Assume $E$ has finite measure. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $E$ that converges pointiwse on $E$ to the real-valued function $f$. THen for all $\epsilon > 0$, there is a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ for which $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ uniformly on $F$ and $m(E$~$F) < \epsilon$

- Under the assumptions of Egoroff's Thm, for all $\nu > 0$ and $\delta > 0$, there is a measurable subset $A$ of $E$ and an index $N$ for which $|f_n - f| < \nu$ on $A$ for all $n \geq N$ and $m(E$~$A) < \delta$.

- Let $f$ be a simple function defined on $E$. Then for each $\epsilon > 0$, there is a continuous function $g$ on $\mathbb{R}$ and a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ for which $f=g$ on $F$ and $m(E$~$F) < \epsilon$

- Let $f$ be a real-valued measurable function on $E$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0$, there is a continuous function $g$ on $\mathbb{R}$ amd a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ for which $f=g$ on $F$ and $m(E$~$F) < \epsilon$

### Royden Chapter 4 (Integration)

- The **upper and lower sums** for $f$ with respect to a partition $P$ are
$$L(f,P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i \times (x_i-x_{i-1})$$
$$U(f,P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i \times (x_i-x_{i-1})$$
where $m_i$ is the infimum on the given partition, and $M_i$ is the supremum

- The **lower and upper Riemann integrals** of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are defined by (respectively)
$$\int_a^b f = \mathrm{sup}\{L(f,P)\}$$
$$\int_a^b f = \mathrm{inf}\{U(f,P)\}$$
where $P$ is a partition of $[a,b]$.

- If the two above mentioned integrals are equal, then we say that $f$ is **Riemann integrable** over $[a,b]^2$.

- For a simple function $\psi$ defined on a set og finite measure $E$, we define the integral of $\psi$ over $E$ by
$$\int_E \psi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \times m(E_i)$$
where $\psi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \times \chi_{E_i}$ and each $E_i = \{x \in E| \psi(x) = a_i\}$

- Let $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite disjoint collection of measurable subsets of a set of finite meausre $E$. For $1 \leq i \leq n$, let $a_i$ be a real number. If $\phi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \times \chi_{E_i}$ on $E$, then 
$$\int_E \phi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \times m(E_i)$$

- **Linearity and Monotonicity of Integration**: Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be simple functions defined on a set of finite measure $E$. Then for any $\alpha$ and $\beta$,
$$\int_E (\alpha \phi + \beta \psi) = \alpha \int_E \phi + \beta \int_E \psi$$
Moreover, if $\phi \leq \psi$ on $E$, then
$$\int_E \phi \leq \int_E \psi$$

- A bounded function $f$ ona domain $E$ of finite measure is said to be **Lebesgue integrable** over $E$ provided its upper and lower Lebesgue integrals over $E$ are equal. The common value of the upper and lower integrals is called the **Lebesgue integral**.

- Let $f$ be a bounded function defined on the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$. If $f$ is Riemann integrable over $[a,b]$, then it is Lebesgue integrable over $[a,b]$ and the two integrals are equal.

- Let $f$ be a bounded measurable function on a set of finite meausre $E$. Then $f$ is integrable over $E$.

- Let $f$ and $g$ be bounded measurable functions on a set of finite measure $E$. Then for any $\alpha$ and $\beta$,
$$\int_E (\alpha f + \beta g) = \alpha \int_E f + \beta \int_E g$$
Moreover, if $f \leq g$ on $E$, then
$$\int_E f \leq \int_E g$$

- Let $f$ be a bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure $E$. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint meausrable subsets of $E$. Then
$$\int_{A \cup B} f = \int_A f + \int_B f$$

- Let $f$ be a bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure $E$. Then,
$$\left| \int_E f \right| \leq \int_E |f|$$

- Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of bounded measurable functions on a set of finite measure $E$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ uniformly on $E$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E f_n = \int_E f$

- **The Bounded Convergence Theorem**: Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on a set of finite measure $E$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly pointwise bounded on $E$, that is, there exists a number $M \geq 0$ for which $|f_n| \leq M$ on $E$ for all $n$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ pointwise on $E$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E f_n = \int_E f$

- **Chebychev's Inequality**: Let $f$ be a nonnegative measurable function on $E$. Then for any $\lambda > 0$, 
$$m(\{x \in E| f(x) \geq \lambda\}) \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} \int_E f$$

- Let $f$ be a nonnegative measurable function on $E$. Then $\int_E f = 0$ iff $f=0$ a.e. on $E$.

- **Linearity and Monotonicity** follow for nonnegative measurable functions.

- **Fatou's Lemma**: Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of nonnegative measurable functions on $E$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ pointwise a.e. on $E$, then $\int_E f \leq \mathrm{liminf} \int_E f_n$

- **Monotone Convergence Theorem**: Let $\{f_n\}$ be an increasing sequence of nonnegative measurable functions on $E$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ pointwise a.e. on $E$, then 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E f_n = \int_E f$$

- A nonnegative measurable function $f$ on a measurable set $E$ is said to be **integrable** over $E$ provided $\int_E f < \infty$

- Let the nonnegative function $f$ be integrable over $E$. Then $f$ is finite a.e. on $E$.

- Let $f$ be a measurable function on $E$. Then $f^+$ and $f^-$ are integrable over $E$ iff $|f|$ is integrable over $E$.

- A measurable function $f$ on $E$ is said to be **integrable** over $E$ provided $\int_E |f| < \infty$. When this is so, we define the integral by 
$$\int_E f = \int_E f^+ - \int_E f^-$$

- Let $f$ be integrable over $E$. THen $f$ is finite a.e. on $E$ and $\int_E f = \int_{E/E_0} f$ if $E_0 \subseteq E$ such that $m(E_0) = 0$.

- **The Integral Comparison Test**: Let $f$ be a measurable function on $E$. Suppose there is a nonnegative function $g$ that is integrable over $E$ and dominates $f$ in the sense that $|f| \leq g$ on $E$. Then $f$ is integrable over $E$ and
$$\left| \int_E f \right| \leq \int_E |f|$$

- If $f$ and $g$ are integrable functions on $E$, then **linearity** and **monotonicity** follow.

- Let $f$ be integrable over $E$. Assume $A$ and $B$ are disjoint measurable subsets of $E$. Then 
$$\int_{A \cup B} f = \int_A f + \int_B f$$

- **Dominated Convergence Theorem**: Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $E$. Suppose there is an integrable function $g$ on $E$ and dominates $\{f_n\}$ on $E$ in the sense that $|f_n| \leq g$ on $E$ for all $n$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ pointwise a.e. on $E$, then $f$ is integrable over $E$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E f_n = \int_E f$.

- **General Dominated Convergence Theorem**: Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $E$ that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$. Suppose there is a sequence $\{g_n\}$ of nonnegative measurable functions on $E$ that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $g$ and dominates $\{f_n\}$ on $E$ in the sense that $|f_n| \leq g_n$ on $E$ for all $n$. If
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E g_n = \int_E g < \infty$$
then,
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E f_n = \int_E f$$

- Let $E$ be a set of finite measure and $\delta > 0$. Then $E$ is the disjoint union of a finite collection of sets, each of which has measure less than $\delta$.

- A family $\mathcal{F}$ of measuable functions on $E$ is said to be **uniformly integrable** over $E$ provided for each $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that for each $f \in \mathcal{F}$, if $A \subseteq E$ is measurable and $m(A) < \delta$, then $\int_A |f| < \epsilon$.

- Let $\{f_n\}_{k=1} ^n$ be a finite collection of functions, each of which is integrable over $E$. Then $\{f_n\}_{k=1} ^n$ is uniformly integrable.

- **Vitali COnvergence Theorem**: Let $E$ be of finite measure. Suppose the sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable over $E$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ a.e. on $E$, then $f$ is integrable over $E$ and

### Royden Chapter 6 (Differentiation)

- Let $f$ be a monotone function on the open interval $(a,b)$. Then $f$ is continuous except possibly at a countable number of points in $(a,b)$.

- If the function $f$ is monotone on the open interval $(a,b)$, then it is differentiable almost everywhere on $(a,b)$

### Royden Chapter 7 ($L^p$ Spaces)

- For most of this section, unless otherwise stated, define $E$ to be a measurable set of real numbers, and $\mathcal{F}$ to be the collection of all measurable extended real-valued functions on $E$ that are finite a.e. on $E$. Define $f$ and $g \in \mathcal{F}$ to be equivalent and $f \cong g$ iff $f(x) = g(x)$ for almost all $x \in E$.

- We call a function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ **essentially bounded** provided there is some $M \geq 0$ called an **essential upper bound** for $f$ for which $|f(x)| \leq M$ for almost all $x \in E$

- **functionals** are real-valued functions that have as their domain linear spaces of functions

- Let $X$ be a linear space. A real-valued functional $|| \cdot ||$ on $X$ is called a **norm** provided for each $f$ and $g$ in $X$, and each real number $c$, $||f|| \geq 0$ and $||f|| = 0$ iff $f =0$,
$$||f+g|| \leq ||f||+||g||$$
$$||cf|| = |c|||f||$$

- By a **normed linear space** we mean a linear space together with a norm. If $X$ is a linear space normed by $|| \cdot ||$ we say that a function in $X$ is a **unit function** provided $||f|| = 1$

- For any $f \in X$, $f \neq 0$, the function $\frac{f}{||f||}$ is a unit function: it is a scalar multiple of $f$ which we call the **normalization** of $f$

- **The Normed Linear Space $L^1(E)$**
$$||f||_1 = \int_E |f|$$

- **The Normed Linear Space $L^{\infty}(E)$**: For a function $f \in L^{\infty}(E)$, define $||f||_{\infty}$ to be the infimum of the essential upper bounds for $f$. We call $||f||_{\infty}$ the **essential supremum** of $f$ and claim that $|| \cdot ||$ is a norm on $L^{\infty}(E)$

- $||f||_{\mathrm{max}} = \mathrm{max}_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)|$ is a norm and is called the **maximum norm**

- For a measurable set $E$ where $1<p< \infty$ and a function $f$ in $L^p(E)$, define 
$$||f||_p = \left[ \int_E |f|^p \right]^{1/p}$$

- The conjugate of a number $p \in (1, \infty)$ is the number $q = \frac{p}{p-1}$, which is the unique number $q \in (1, \infty)$ for which 
$$\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$$
Note, the conjugate of $1$ is defined to be $\infty$ and vice versa.

- **Young's Inequality**: For $1<p< \infty$, $q$ is the conjugate of $p$ and any two positive numbers $a$ and $b$,
$$ab \leq \frac{a^p}{p}+\frac{b^q}{q}$$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set $1 \leq p < \infty$, and $q$ be the conjugate of $p$. If $f$ belongs to $L^p(E)$ and $g$ belongs to $L^q(E)$, then their product $f \cdot g$ is integrable over $E$ and 
$$\int_E |f \cdot g| \leq ||f||_p \cdot ||g||_q$$
This is known as **Holder's Inequality**. 

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. If the functions $f$ and $g$ belong to $L^p(E)$, then so does their sum $f+g$ and moreover,
$$||f+g||_p \leq ||f||_p + ||g||_p$$

- **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**: Let $E$ be a maeasurable set and $f$ and $g$ measurable functions on $E$ for which $f^2$ and $g^2$ are integrable over $E$. Then their product $f \cdot g$ is also integrable over $E$ and 
$$\int_E |fg| \leq \sqrt{\int_E f^2} \cdot \sqrt{\int_E g^2}$$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 < p < \infty$. Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of functions in $L^p(E)$ that is bounded in $L^p(E)$ in the sense that there is a constant $M$ for which $||f||_p \leq M$ for all $f$ in $\mathcal{F}$. Then the family $\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly integrable over $E$.

- Let $E$ be a measurable set of finite measure and $1 \leq p_1 < p_2 \leq \infty$. Then $L^{p_2}(E) \subseteq L^{p_1}(E)$. Furthermore $||f||_{p_1} \leq c||f||_{p_2}$ for all $f$ in $L^{p_2}(E)$ where $c = [m(E)]^{\frac{p_2 - p_1}{p_1p_2}}$ if $p_2 < \infty$ and $c = [m(E)]^{\frac{1}{p_1}}$ if $p_2 = \infty$

- A sequence $\{f_n\}$ in a linear space $X$ that is normed by $|| \cdot ||$ is said to **converge to $f$ in $X$** provided $\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f - f_n|| = 0$. This can also be written as $\{f_n\} \to f$ in $X$ or $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = f$ in $X$. 

- A sequence $\{f_n\}$ in a linear space $X$ that is normed by $|| \cdot ||$ is said to be **Cauchy** in $X$ provided for each $\epsilon > 0$, there is a natural number $N$ such that $||f_n - f_m|| < \epsilon$ for all $m,n \geq N$. 

- A normed linear space $X$ is said to be **complete** provided every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a function in $X$. A complete normed linear space is called a **Banach space**

- Let $X$ be a normed linear space. Then every convergent sequence in $X$ is Cauchy. Moreover, a Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges if it has a convergent subsequence.

- Let $X$ be a linear space normed by $|| \cdot ||$. A sequence $\{f_n\}$ in $X$ is said to be **rapidly Cauchy** provided there is a convergent series of positive numbers $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \epsilon_k$ for which $||f_{k+1} - f_k|| \leq \epsilon_k ^2$ for all $k$

- Let $X$ be a normed linear space. Then every rapidly Cauchy sequence in $X$ is Cauchy. Furthermore, every Cauchy sequence has a rapidly Cauchy subsequence.

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Then every rapidly Cauchy sequence in $L^p(E)$ converges both wrt the $L^p(E)$ norm and pointwise a.e. on $E$ to a function in $L^p(E)$.

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Then $L^p(E)$ is a Banach space. Moreover, if $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ in $L^p(E)$, a subsequence of $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence in $L^p(E)$ that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to the function $f$ which belongs to $L^p(E)$. Then $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ in $L^p(E)$ iff $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E |f_n|^p = \int_E |f|^p$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence in $L^p(E)$ that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to the function $f$ which belongs to $L^p(E)$. Then $\{f_n\} \to f$ in $L^p(E)$ iff $\{|f|^p\}$ is uniformly integrable and tight over $E$.

- Let $X$ be a normed linear space with norm $|| \cdot ||$. Given two subsets $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of $X$ with $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{G}$, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is **dense** in $\mathcal{G}$, provided for each function $g \in \mathcal{G}$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is a function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ for which $||f-g|| < \epsilon$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Then the subspace of simple functions in $L^p(E)$ is dense in $L^p(E)$

- Let $[a,b]$ be a closed, bounded interval and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Then the subspace of step functions on $[a,b]$ is dense in $L^p[a,b]$

- A normed linear space $X$ is said to be **separable** provided there is a countable subset that is dense in $X$.

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Then the normed linear space $L^p(E)$ is separable.

- The **linear span** of a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of a linear space $X$ is the linear space consisting of all linear combinations of functions in $\mathcal{S}$, that is, the linear space of functions of the form $f = \sum^n _{k=1} \alpha_k \cdot f_k$ where each $\alpha_k$ is a real number and each $f_k$ belongs to $\mathcal{S}$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a bounded sequence in $L^p(E)$ and $f$ belongs to $L^p(E)$. Then $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly to $f$ in $L^p(E)$ iff for every measurable subset $A$ of $E$, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_A f_n = \int_A f$. If $p > 1$, it is sufficient to consider sets $A$ of finite measure.
