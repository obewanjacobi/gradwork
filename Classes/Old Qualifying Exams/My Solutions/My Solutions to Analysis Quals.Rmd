### Prove that if $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue measure $0$, then $m(\{e^x | x \in A\}) = 0$.
#### My Solution:
Let $m(A) = 0$ and $E = \{\mathrm{e}^x|x \in A\}$. First note that we know $f(x) = \mathrm{e}^x$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Let $A_N = [-N,N] \cap A$, then 
$$A = \bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty} A_N$$
Also, $m(A) = 0 \implies m(A_N) = 0$ for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$. By definition of Lebesgue measure, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a sequence of intervals $\{I_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ such that $I_i \cap I_j$ is the empty set for all $i$ and $j$. Also, $A_N \subset \cup I_n$ such that $\sum_n l(I_n) < \epsilon$ since $m(A_N) = 0$. Let $I_n = (a_n,b_n)$, $I_n^* = [a_n,b_n]$, then $m(I_n) = m(I_n^*)$. Then 
$$m(f(A_N)) < \sum_n m(f(I_n)) = \sum_n m(f(I_n^*))$$
Since $f$ is continuous, we know that $m(f(I_n^*)) = \max_{x \in I_n^*} f(x) - \min_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$. Since $I_n^*$ is a closed interval and $f$ is continuous, we can find $x_1$ and $x_2 \in I_n^*$ such that $f(x_1) = \max_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$ and $f(x_2) = \min_{x \in I_n^*} f(x)$. WLOG we can assume that $x_1 \leq x_2$. Then, 
$$m(f(I_n^*)) = f(x_1) - f(x_2) \leq |f'(\alpha)|(x_1-x_2) $$
$$\leq \max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) \times l(I_n) \leq \max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) \epsilon$$
where $\alpha \in (x_1,x_2)$

Since $\max_{x \in I_n^*} f'(x) < \infty$ and $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we find that $m(f(I_n)) = 0$. This implies $m(f(A_N)) = 0$ which implies 
$$m(f(A)) = m(f(\cup^{\infty}_N A_N)) \leq \sum_{N}^{\infty} m(f(A_N)) = 0$$
Thus, $m(f(A)) = m(E) = 0$. QED



### Prove that if $f:[0,1] \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ is absolutely continuous, then so is $1/f$.
#### My Solution:
Given that $f$ is absolutely continuous, we know then that for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $\{(a_i,b_i)\}^n _{i=1}$ is a finite collection of disjoint intervals of $[0,1]$ with $\sum ^n _{i=1} |b_i - a_i| < \delta$ implies that $\sum ^n _{i=1} |f(b_i) - f(a_i)| < \epsilon$. Also, because $f$ is absolutely continuous, we know then that it must also be continuous. Hence, $f$  must be bounded on $[0,1]$. Let $m = \min(f)$ on $[0,1]$ and choose $\delta$ such that $\sum ^n _{i=1} |b_i - a_i| < \delta$ gives us 
$$\sum ^n _{i=1} |f(b_i) - f(a_i)| < m^2\epsilon$$
Then note that 
$$\sum ^n _{i=1} \left|\frac{1}{f(b_i)} - \frac{1}{f(a_i)} \right| =  \sum ^n _{i=1} \left|\frac{f(b_i) - f(a_i)}{f(a_i)f(b_i)} \right|$$
$$ \leq \frac{1}{m^2} \sum ^n _{i=1} |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| < \frac{m^2 \epsilon}{m^2} = \epsilon$$
Hence, $\frac{1}{f}$ is absolutely continuous as well. QED



### Prove that if $f$ is absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$ and there is a $g \in C([0,1])$ such that $f' = g$ a.e., then $f$ is differentiable on $[0,1]$ and $f'=g$.
#### My Solution:
Using Lebesgue's fundamental theorem of calculus, we know that 
$$f(x) = f(0) + \int_0 ^x f'$$
Then, because $f' = g$ a.e.;
$$f(x) = f(0) + \int_0 ^x g$$
This implies that $\int_0 ^x f' = \int_0 ^x g$, thus by the fundamental theorem of calculus, if we take the derivative of both sides, we can see that $f'(x) = g(x)$ for all $x$. Note, the reason that we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus here is because the function $f$ is absolutely continuous, which implies it's of bounded variation. QED



### Prove that the series $\sum^{\infty} _{k=0} \sin ^k t$ converges uniformly for $t \in [-\pi/4, \pi/4]$ and then evaluate the following series:
$$\sum^{\infty} _{k=0} \int ^{\pi / 4} _{-\pi / 4} \sin ^k (t)dt$$ 

#### My Solution:
Recall the **Weierstrass M Test**: Let $\sum^{\infty} _{n=1} f_n$ be a series of real valued functions on a subset $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. Suppose there exists a convergent series $\sum ^{\infty} _{n=1} M_n$ where $M_n \geq 0$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x \in A$, $|f_n(x)| \leq M_n$. Then $\sum^{\infty} _{n=1} f_n$ converges uniformly.

Now, for $t \in [-\pi/4, \pi/4]$, $\sin ^k (t) \leq \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^k$ for all $k$. Note, $\sum^{\infty} _ {k=1} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^k$ converges because it is a geometric series. Thus by the Weierstrass M test, the series converges uniformly for $t \in [-\pi/4, \pi/4]$. QED

Because the series converges uniformly on a compact set, 
$$\sum^{\infty} _{k=1} \int^{\pi/4} _{-\pi/4} \sin ^k (t) dt = \int^{\pi/4} _{-\pi/4} \sum^{\infty} _{k=1}\sin ^k (t) dt = \int^{\pi/4} _{-\pi/4} \frac{1}{1-\sin(t)}dt$$
$$= \int^{\pi/4} _{-\pi/4} \frac{1 + \sin(t)}{\cos ^2 (t)}dt = \int^{\pi/4} _{-\pi/4} \sec ^2 (t) dt + \int^{\pi/4} _{-\pi/4} \tan(t) \sec(t) dt$$
$$=\tan(t)|^{\pi/4}_{-\pi/4} +\sec(t)|^{\pi/4}_{-\pi/4}= 1-(-1)+\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{2} = 2$$ QED



### Let $\{E_n\} \subset \mathcal{M}$ be a sequence of Lebesgue measurable subsets of $[0,1]$. Prove: (a) If $\sum m(E_n) < \infty$ then $m(\lim \sup E_n) = 0$; and (b) If $m(E_n) \to 0$ it may not be true that $m(\lim \sup E_n) = 0$
#### My Solution:
a) Let $\epsilon > 0$, since $\sum m(E_n) < \infty$, there exists an $N$ such that $\sum m(E_N) < \epsilon$. So, 
$$\lim \sup (E_n) = \bigcap^{\infty} _{n=1} \bigcup^{\infty} _{k=n} E_k \subset \bigcup^{\infty} _{k=n} E_k$$
Hence,
$$m(\lim \sup (E_n)) \leq m \left(\bigcup^{\infty} _{k=N} E_k \right) \leq \sum^{\infty} _{k=n} m(E_k) < \epsilon$$
This implies that $m(\lim \sup E_n) = 0$.

b) Let $E_1 = [0,1]$, $E_2 = [0,\frac{1}{2}]$, $E_3 = [\frac{1}{2},1]$, $E_4 = [0, \frac{1}{4}]$, $E_5 = [\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}]$, $E_6 = [\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}]$, $E_7 = [\frac{3}{4}, 1]$, $E_8 = [0, \frac{1}{8}]$,...
We repeat these definitions in this pattern, giving us that $\lim_{n \to \infty} m(E_n) = 0$. But for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\bigcup^{\infty} _{k=n} E_k = [0,1]$ implying that $\lim \sup (E_n) = [0,1]$. Thus it may not be true that if $m(E_n) \rightarrow 0$ that $m(\limsup (E_n))=0$. QED



### Prove that if $f \in L^p([0,\infty))$, $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0 ^{\infty} f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx}dx = 0$
#### My Solution:
Let $A = \{x| f(x) < 1\}$ and $B = \{x|f(x) \geq 1\}$. Note, since $f \in L^p$, $m(B) < \infty$. So,
$$\int^{\infty} _0 f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} dx = \int (f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} \chi_A + f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} \chi_B) dx$$
where
$$\int^{\infty} _0 f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} \chi_A dx < \int^{\infty} _0 \mathrm{e}^{-x} = 1$$
and
$$\int f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} \chi_B dx \leq \int |f|^p \chi_B < \infty$$
since $f \in L^p$. Thus by the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem,
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int^{\infty} _0 f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} dx = \int^{\infty} _0 \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) \mathrm{e}^{-nx} dx = \int 0 dx = 0$$ QED



### Define the function $f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = 0$ if $x$ is irrational, and by $f(x) = \frac{1}{q}$ if $x$ is rational and $x = \frac{p}{q}$ when written in least terms. Decide whether or not $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$ and if so, evaluate its integral.
#### My Solution:
Let $A = \{x|\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \neq f(a)\}$, then $A = \{x| x\in \mathbb{Q}\}$. Thus $m(A) = 0$. Also $f$ is clearly measurable as $\{x|f(x) \geq a\} = \{(0, \infty)\}$. Hence $f$ is Lebesgue measurable and $\int f = R f$ with $\int f =0$ since $f=0$ a.e. QED



### Let $\{p_n\}$ be a sequence of polynomials. Suppose that for every point $x \in [0,1]$ there exists an index $n$ satisfying $p_n(x) = 0$. Prove at least one of the polynomials is identically zero.
#### My Solution:
Suppose there does not exist an $n$ such that $P_n = 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let's define $S_n = \{x \in [0,1]|P_n(x) = 0\}$. Note, $S_n$ has to be finite since each polynomial can only have a finite number of zeros. Now consider $\bigcup^{\infty} _{n=1} S_n \supseteq [0,1]$ since for each $x \in [0,1]$ there exists a polynomial such that $p_n(x) = 0$. But a countable collection of finite sets is countable. But $[0,1]$ is uncountable, thus giving us a contradiction. This implies that one of the polynomials must indeed be identically zero. QED



### Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. Prove that the following are equivalent to each other: (a) $A$ is not Lebesgue measurable; and (b) There is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that whenever $B$ is measurable and $A \subset B$, then $m^*(B/A) \geq \epsilon$.
#### My Solution:
Let $A$ not be Lebesgue measurable and suppose that for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $B$ such that $A \subset B$ and $m^* (B-A) < \epsilon$. So for every $\frac{1}{n}$, let $B_n \supset A$ and $m^* (B_n - A) < \frac{1}{n}$. Then $A \subset \cap B_n$ and $m^*((\cap B_n) - A) = 0$. Since $m^*((\cap B_n) -A) = 0$ which implies $(\cap B_n) - A$ is measurable (because Lebesgue measure is complete). Hence, $A = [(\cup (B_n ^c)) \cup (\cap (B_n) - A)]^c$ is measurable. This is a contradiction, thus we have proven the desired result. QED



### Let $h \in L^{\infty} (\mathbb{R})$. Define a functional $T: L^1 (\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ by $Tf = \int_{\mathbb{R}} (fh) dm$. Prove that $\sup_{||f||_1 \leq 1} Tf = ||h||_{\infty}$
#### My Solution:
- Will show $\leq$:

$$\sup_{||f||_1 \leq 1} Tf = \sup_{||f||_1 \leq 1} \int fh \leq \sup_{||f||_1 \leq 1} ||f||_1 ||h||_{\infty}$$ Note, by Holder's since we have $1, \infty$, 
$$\leq 1 \cdot ||h||_{\infty} = ||h||_{\infty}$$

- Will show $\geq$:

We may assume $||h||_{\infty} = M > 0$. $\mathbb{R}$ is $\sigma$-finite, so there exists $F_n$ increasing towards $x$ such that $m(F_n) < a$. Define $A_n = \{x \in F_n| |h(x)| > a\}$ for $0<a<M$, to be fixed. Hence $m(A_n) > 0$. Define $g_n(x) = \frac{\mathrm{sgn}(h) - \chi_{A_n}}{m(A_n)}$, which is implies $||g_n||_1 = 1$ for all $n$ and $\int h g_n = a$ for all $n$. Thus $a < \int h g_n$ for all $n$. This implies $\sup_{0<a<M} a < \sup_{||g_n||_1 \leq 1} \int h g_n$. $$||f||_{\infty} = M < \sup_{||f||_1 \leq 1} \int fh = \sup_{||f||_1 \leq 1} Tf$$
Thus we have proven the desired result. QED

### Let $C \subset [0,1]$ be a closed set. Prove that $\chi_C$ is Riemann integrable iff $\partial C$ has Lebesgue measure zero.
#### My Solution:
Assume that $\partial C$ has Lesbegue mesure zero. This implies that $m(\{x| \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \neq f(a)\}) = 0$. Thus the Riemann integral exists and agrees with the Lesbesgue integral.

Now assume that $\chi_C$ is Riemann integrable. This is true iff the Lesbegue integral exists and $m(\{x|\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \neq f(a)\}) = 0$. So $\chi_C$ is discontinuous at its boundary points, which implies that $m(\partial C) = 0$. QED



### Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}$ Prove the following statements are equivalent: (a) $S$ is Lebesgue measurable and (b) There is a $G_{\delta}$ set $G$ and a set $N$ of measure zero such that $S = G-N$.
#### My Solution:
($b \implies a$): Given $G$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set, $G$ must then be Borel measurable. Thus it is also Lebesgue measurable. $N$ must be Lebesgue measurable as well since the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra is complete. Thus $S = G-N$ is Lebesgue measurable.

($a \implies b$): This follows directly from a proposition stating that if $A \subset [0,1]$ is a Lebesgue measurable set, and $m$ is a Lebesgue measure, then there exists a set $H$ which cintains $A$ that is the countable intersection of a decreasing sequence of open sets and $m(H-A)=0$. QED



###If $f$ is nonnegative and integrable on $[0,1]$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} = m \{x| f(x) > 0\}$
#### My Solution:
$$\int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} = \int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} \cdot \chi_{f=0} + \int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} \cdot \chi_{f>0}$$
where $\int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} \cdot \chi_{f=0} = \int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{0} = 0$. Thus,
$$\int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} = \int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} \cdot \chi_{f>0}$$
Since $f$ is integrable, we know that $\int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} < \int_0 ^1 f < \infty$, thus $\sqrt[n]{f}$ is integrable as well. So,
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0 ^1 \sqrt[n]{f} \cdot \chi_{f>0} = \int_0 ^1 \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{f} \cdot \chi_{f>0}$$ by the D.C.T., and thus,
$$= \int_0 ^1 1 \cdot \chi_{f>0} = m(\{x|f(x) > 0\})$$
QED




###Let $f \in L^1 (\mathbb{R})$. If $\int_a ^b f = 0$ for all rational numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$, then $f = 0$ a.e.
#### My Solution:
We will claim here that $f$ integrates to $0$ over arbitrary open sets. Thus for any $\epsilon > 0$, choose an open set $B$ such that $A = \{f>0\} \subset B$ and $m(B-A) < \delta$. Hence
$$\left|\int_A f\right| \leq \left|\int_B f - \int_A f \right| = \left|\int_{B-A} f \right| \leq \int_{B-A} |f| < \epsilon$$
because $m(B-A) < \delta$. Thus the integral is $0$ since this is true for all $\epsilon$.

We must now prove our claim in order to complete the problem. For any $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, there exists $\{a_n\}, \{b_n\} \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a_n$ decreases to $a$ and $b_n$ increases to $b$ as $n$ goes to infinity. Thus $\int_{(a,b)} f = \int_{\cup(a_n,b_n)} f$. Using this, and the dominated convergence theorem, we find that
$$\int_{\cup(a_n,b_n)} f = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{(a_n,b_n)} f = 0$$ with $|f|$ as the majorant since $f \in L^1$. Now let $B = \bigcup^{\infty} _{n=1} (a_n,b_n)$ with $(a_n,b_n)$ being arbitrary disjoint intervals. Then 
$$\int_B f = \int \sum^{\infty} _{n=1} f \cdot \chi_{(a_n,b_n)}$$
By the dominated convergence theorem, 
$$\int \sum^{\infty} _{n=1} f \cdot \chi_{(a_n,b_n)} = \sum^{\infty} _{n=1} \int f \cdot \chi_{(a_n,b_n)} = \sum 0 = 0$$ with $|f|$ as the majorant because $f \in L^1$. Thus $\int_B f = 0$ for any open set $B$. A similar proof holds for $m(\{x|f(x) < 0\}) = 0$. Hence $f = 0$ a.e. QED



### Suppose that $f \in L^2 ([0,1])$ and $||f||_2 = 1$. Define $g(x) = xf(x)$. Prove that $g \in L^1 ([0,1])$ and that $||g||_1 \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
#### My Solution:
For $x \in L^2 ([0,1])$, we have 
$$\left(\int_0 ^1 |f|^2 \right) ^{1/2} = \left(\frac{1}{3} x^3 |^1 _0 \right)^{1/2} < \infty$$
So $x \in L^2$. Given this, we can see that 
$$||x \cdot f(x)||_1 \leq ||x||_2 ||f||_2$$ by Holders' because $2$ and $2$ are conjugate.
Then,
$$||x||_2 ||f||_2 \leq \left(\frac{1}{3} x^3 |^1 _0 \right)^{1/2} \cdot 1 \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$
QED



### Let $\{a_k\}$ be a sequence of real numbers with the property that $|a_k| \leq 1$ for all $k$. Prove that both series $f(x) = \sum^{\infty} _{k=1} a_k x^k$, $g(x) = \sum^{\infty} _{k=1} k a_k x^{k-1}$ converge uniformly on every compact subinterval of $(-1,1)$ and that $f'(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in (-1,1)$.
#### My Solution: 
Since $|a_k| \leq 1$, 
$$\sum^{\infty} _{k=1} a_k x^k \leq \sum^{\infty}_{k=1} x^k$$ which converges uniformly because $|x| < 1$ by the Weirstrass-M test (and because it's a geometric series). Let $C \subset [0,1]$ be a compact interval of $(-1,1)$ and let $a = \mathrm{max}\{|x|: x \in C\}$. Then $\sum |x|^k \leq \sum a^k$ which converges because it's a geometric sequence. Now we apply the Weirstrass M-test to give us the desired result. 

As for proving that $f'(x) = g(x)$, we simply note that by definition of differentiation on power series that this is true (with simple calculus II logic). QED



### Give an example of a continuous function $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with the property that $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, yet $f'(x) \leq -1$ for almost every $x \in [0,1]$.
#### My Solution:
Let $C(x)$ be the Cantor function on $[0,1]$. Consider $f(x) = 2C(x) -x$. Then $f(0) = 2 \cdot 0 - 0 = 0$ and $f(1) = 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1$. Also, almost everywhere the derivative of the Cantor function is 0 (because almost everywhere it is constant). Then the derivative almost everywhere of $f(x)$ would be $f'(x) = -1$ almost everywhere. 



### Let $E_1, E_2, E_3,...$ be a sequence of measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ with the property that $\sum^{\infty} _{n=1} m (E_n) < \infty$. Show almost every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is contained in only finitely many of the $E_n$.
#### My Solution:
By way of contradiction, suppose there exists an $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $m(I) = c > 0$. Also assume that $I \subset E^* _n$ for all $n$ where $\{E^*_n\}$ is a subsequence of $\{E_n\}$. But 
$$\sum^{\infty} _{n=1} m(E^*_n) \geq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} m(I) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} c$$ which diverges because $c > 0$. Thus by contradiction, we have proven the desired result. QED



### Let $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be Lebesgue measurable. Prove that if $p \leq f(x) \leq q$ for all $x \in [0,1]$, then $\int_{[0,1]} f$ exists and $p \leq \int_{[0,1]} f \leq q$.
#### My Solution:
First off, it is known that $\int_{[0,1]} 1 = 1$. Since $p \leq f \leq q$, and since we're integrating between $0$ and $1$, we can easily see then that $p \leq \int_{[0,1]} f \leq q$. Let $a = \mathrm{max}\{|p|,|q|\}$, then $|f| < a$ which implies that $\int_{[0,1]} |f| < a$. Thus $f$ is integrable. QED



### Define a sequence of functions $f_n \in L^1[0,1]$ by $f_n(x) = n$ if $x \leq \frac{1}{n}$ and $f(x) = 0$ if $x > \frac{1}{n}$. Does $f_n$ converge in $L^1 ([0,1])$? If so, to what function?
#### My Solution: 
Suppose $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^p$. Then $||f_n||_1 \rightarrow ||f||_1$. But $\int|f_n| = \frac{1}{n} \cdot n = 1$ for all $n$. Hence $||f|| = 1$. However, this is a contradiction because $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = 0$, thus it does not converge in $L^1 ([0,1])$. QED

### Let $S$ be dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Prove or give a counterexample: $f$ is measurable iff $\{x : f(x) \geq s\}$ is measurable for all $s \in S$.
#### My Solution:
First assume $f$ is measurable. This implies that $\{x|f(x) \geq a\}$ is Lebesgue measurable for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Hence $\{x| f(x) \geq s\}$ is Lebesgue measurable for all $s \in S$.

Now assume that $\{x: f(x) \geq s\}$ is measurable for all $s \in S$. It suffices to show that $\{x: f(x) > s\}$ is measurable for all $s \in S^c$. So, let $t \in S^c$, given that $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. Let $\{t_n\} \subset S$ such that $t_n$ decreases to $t$. Thus,
$$\{x: f(x) > t\} = \bigcup^{\infty} _{n=1} \{x|f(x) \geq t_n\}$$
is the union of measurable sets. Hence $f$ is measurable. QED



### Suppose $\lambda(S)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure of the set $S \subset \mathbb{R}$. Let $g: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be absolutely continuous and $E \subset [0,1]$ be such that $\lambda(E) = 0$. Prove that $\lambda(g(E)) = 0$.
#### My Solution:
Given $E \subset [0,1]$ with $\lambda(E) = 0$, let $\{(a_i,b_i)\}$ be a collection of disjoint intervals covering $E$ with $\sum^n _{i = 1} |b_i - a_i| < \delta$. $g$ is absolutely continuous, which implies that it must also be continuous. Thus for each $(a_i,b_i)$, let $(c_i,d_i) \subseteq (a_i,b_i)$ such that $\{f(c_i),f(d_i)\} \in \{\mathrm{min}(f)_{(a_i,b_i)}, \mathrm{max}(f)_{(a_i,b_i)}\}$. Also, recall that because $g$ is continuous, this implies that for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta$ such that $|f(a_i)-f(b_i)| < \epsilon$ where $|a_i - b_i| < \delta$. Now notice that 
$$\sum^n _{i=1} |c_i - d_i| < \sum^n _{i=1} |b_i - a_i| < \delta$$
because $(c_i,d_i) \subseteq (a_i,b_i)$. Thus
$$\lambda(g(E)) \leq \lambda \left(g \left(\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}(a_i, b_i)\right) \right) = \lambda\left(\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1} g (a_i,b_i)\right)$$
$$\leq \sum^{\infty} _{i=1} \lambda(g(a_i,b_i)) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{i=1} |f(c_i) - f(d_i)| < \epsilon$$ 
because $\sum |c_i - d_i| < \delta$. Thus $\lambda(g(E)) = 0$. QED



### Let $f_n(x) = x^n$ for each $n \geq 1$. Prove that the sequence $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on $[-\delta,\delta]$ for each $0 < \delta < 1$, and converges non-uniformly on $(-1,1)$.
#### My Solution:
Before we begin, note that if $|x|^n < \epsilon$, then $$\ln(|x|^n) < \ln(\epsilon) \implies n \ln(|x|) < \ln(\epsilon)$$
$$ \implies n < \frac{\ln(\epsilon)}{\ln(|x|)}$$. This will be useful in our proof. 

Let $\delta \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Also let $N = \frac{\ln(\epsilon)}{\ln(\delta)}$. Hence for $n \geq N$, $n \ln(\delta) \leq \ln(\epsilon)$ which implies that $\ln(\delta^n) \leq \ln(\epsilon)$. The reason that the inequality changes directions here is because for $\delta \in (0,1)$ and for very small $\epsilon$ (specifically less than $1$), $\ln(\delta), \ln(\epsilon) < 0$. Thus, we can see that $\delta^n \leq \epsilon$, which implies that $x^n < \delta^n < \epsilon$ for all $x \in (-\delta, \delta)$. Thus $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on $[-\delta,\delta]$. 

If we fix $x \in (-1,1)$, this implies that $x^n < \epsilon$ by our previous point in the proof. However, it is not uniform since $N$ depends on $x$. Thus we have proven the desired result. QED



### Let $m(G)$ denote the Lebesgue measure of the set $G$. Find an open set $G$ which is dense in $[0,1]$ such that $m(G) <1$ and $m(G \cap I) > 0$ for any interval $I \subset [0,1]$.
#### My Solution:
Let $\{q_i\}^{\infty}_{i=1}$ represent the rationals in $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$. For each $n$ define $I_n$ as an interval containing $q_n$, $m(I_n) < \frac{1}{4\cdot 2^n}$ and $I_n \subset[0,1]$. Let $G = \bigcup^{\infty} _{i=1} I_n$ with $$m(G) = m \left(\bigcup ^{\infty}_{i=1} I_n \right) \leq \sum^{\infty} _{i=1} m(I_n)$$
$$<\sum^{\infty}_{i=1} \frac{1}{4 \cdot 2^n} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{1-(1/2)} = \frac{1}{2}$$
Since $G$ contains the rationals on $[0,1]$, it is also dense on $[0,1]$. $G$ is open because it is the countable union of open intervals on $[0,1]$. let $I \subset [0,1]$. It must contain a rational, which implies that it intersects any $I_n$ nontrivially, thus $m(I \cap G) > 0$. Thus $G$ is a dense open set on $[0,1]$ such that the measure of $G$ is less than $1$ and intersects any interval of $[0,1]$ nontrivially. QED



### Is $L^p([a,b])$ separable, where $1<p< \infty$?
#### My Solution:
Yes! First note that seperable means that it contains a countable number of dense subsets.

Let $S[a,b] \subset L^p([a,b])$ be step functions on $[a,b]$ and let $S_{\mathbb{Q}}[a,b] \subset S[a,b]$ be step functions of $[a,b]$ with rational endpoints. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, $S_{\mathbb{Q}}[a,b]$ is dense in $S[a,b]$ thus it's dense in $L^p([a,b])$. QED



### Suppose that $1 < p,q < \infty$ and that $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$. Prove that if $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ and $g_n \rightarrow g$ in $L^q(\mathbb{R})$, then $f_ng_n \rightarrow fg$ in $L^1 (\mathbb{R})$.
#### My Solution:
Here it is sufficient to show that $\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_ng_n - fg|| = 0$. Well, 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_ng_n - fg||_1 = \lim_{n \to \infty}||f_ng_n - f_ng + f_ng - fg||_1 $$
$$= \lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_ng_n - f_ng||_1 + ||f_ng-fg||_1$$
$$\leq \lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_n||_p \cdot ||g_n - g||_q + ||f_n -f||_p \cdot ||g||_q = 0$$
by Holder's Inequality, where $\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_n||_p \rightarrow ||f||_p < \infty$, $||g_n-g||_q \rightarrow 0$, and $||f_n -f||_p \rightarrow 0$. Thus  we have proven the desired result. QED

### Assume that $f \in L^{\infty}([0,1])$. Prove that $f \in L^p([0,1])$ for each $1 \leq p < \infty$ and that $||f||_{\infty} = \lim_{p \to \infty} ||f||_p$.
#### My Solution:
To complete this proof, we will divide the problem into a group of lemmas and prove them to get the desired result.

**Lemma 1**: $f \in L^{\infty}([0,1]) \implies f \in L^1([0,1])$
*Proof*: Assume $f \in L^{\infty}$. Then $f \leq m = \mathrm{essup}(f)$ a.e. Then $\int_{[0,1]} |f| \leq \int_{[0,1]} m = m < \infty$. Thus $f \in L^1$.

**Lemma 2**: Assume $f \in L^{\infty}([0,1])$. Then $f \in L^p([0,1])$ for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.
*Proof*: Consider $\int|f|^p = \int_{\{|f|<1 \}} |f|^p + \int_{\{|f| \geq 1\}} |f|^p$.

- where for $p>1$, $\int_{\{|f| <1\}} |f|^p < \int_{\{|f| <1\}} |f| < \infty$ since $f \in L^1$.

- where $\int_{\{|f| \geq 1\}} |f|^p \leq \int_{\{|f| \geq 1\}} m^p = m^p \cdot m(\{|f| \geq 1\}) < \infty$. Thus $\int |f|^p < \infty$, which implies $f \in L^p$. 

**Lemma 3**: $\lim \sup ||f|| \leq ||f||_{\infty}$
*Proof*: $|f| \leq ||f||_{\infty}$ a.e. This implies that $|f|^p \leq ||f||_{\infty}^p$, which implies $(\int_{[0,1]} |f|^p)^{1/p} \leq (\int_{[0,1]} ||f||^p _{\infty}) ^{1/p} = ||f||_{\infty} < \infty$. Hence $\lim \sup ||f||_p \leq ||f||_{\infty}$.

**Lemma 4**:$||f||_{\infty} \leq \liminf ||f||_p$
*Proof*: Let $t \in [0,m = ||f||_{\infty})$. Then $\int |f| = \int _{\{|f| < t\}} |f| + \int _{\{|f| \geq t \}} |f|$. Then $\int |f|^p \geq \int_{\{|f| < 1\}} |f|^p \geq \int_{\{|t| < 1\}} t^p$. Hence $(\int|f|^p)^{(1/p)} \geq (\int_{\{|f| <t\}} t^p)^{1/p} = t \cdot m(\{|f| < t\})^{1/p}$. This implies that $\liminf ||f||_p \geq \liminf t \cdot m(\{|f| < t\})^{1/p} = t \cdot 1$. Thus $\liminf ||f||_p \geq t$ for all $t \in [0, ||f||_{\infty})$. It follows that by our claims then that \lim \sup||f||_p \leq ||f||_{\infty} \leq \liminf ||f||_p$. Thus we have proven the desired result. QED

### Let $C \subset \mathbb{R}$ denote the Cantor set. Let $\chi_C(x) =1$ if $x \in C$ and $0$ otherwise. Explain why $\chi_C$ is Riemann integrable and compute $\int_0 ^1 \chi_C (x)dx$.
#### My Solution:
Given that $m(C) = 0$, $\chi_C (x) = 0$ a.e. which implies that $\int \chi_C = 0$ and since $\chi_C (x)$ is bounded with $m(\{x | \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \neq f(a)\}) = m(C) = 0$. Thus $Rf = \int f = 0$. QED



### Let $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a Lebesgue measurable set with $m(E) =1$. Prove there exists a Lebesgue measurable set $F \subset E$ with $m(F) = \frac{1}{2}$. 
#### My Solution:
$E = \bigcup^{\infty} _{n = 1} E \cap [n, n+1]$. This implies that $m(E) = \lim_{n \to \infty} m(E \cap [-n,n]) = 1$. Pick a sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m(E \cap [-n,n]) > \frac{1}{2}$. Consider $f(x) = \int_{-n} ^x \chi_E$ for $x \in [-n,n]$. Since $f$ is continuous with $f(-n) = 0$ and $f(n) > \frac{1}{2}$, there exists $c \in [-n,n]$ such that $f(c) = \frac{1}{2}$ by the Intermediate Value Theorem. Thus $(-n,n) \cap E$ is a Lebesgue measurable set with $m((-n,c)\cap E) = \frac{1}{2}$. QED



### Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space. If $f_n : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a sequence of functions such that $\sum^{\infty} _{n=1} \int_X |f_n| d \mu$ converges, then prove that $f_n \to 0$ almost everywhere.
#### My Solution:
$$\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \int_X |f_n| d \mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} \sum^k _{n=1} \int_X |f_n| d \mu = \lim_{k \to \infty} \int_X \sum^k _{n =1} |f_n| d \mu$$
$$ = \int_X \lim_{k \to \infty} \sum^k _{n=1} |f_n| d \mu = \int_X \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} |f_n| d \mu < \infty$$
by the M.C.T. since $\sum^k _{i=1} |f_n|$ is increasing. Thus $|f_n| \rightarrow 0$ almost everywhere because it's integrable when $n$ approachest $\infty$. Hence $f_n \rightarrow 0$ almost everywhere. QED 



### Prove that $f(x) = 0$ if $x = 0$ and $f(x) = x^2 \cos (\frac{1}{x^2})$ if $x \neq 0$ is continuous but not absolutely continuous on $[-1,1]$. 
#### My Solution:
Consider $x^2 \cos \left(\frac{1}{x^2} \right)$, which is constructed of functions that are continuous everywhere on their domains. So it is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ excluding $\{0\}$. To show continuity at $x = 0$, consider that $-1 \leq \cos \left(\frac{1}{x^2} \right) \leq 1$ which implies that $-x^2 \leq x^2 \cos \left( \frac{1}{x^2} \right) \leq x^2$ with $\lim_{x \to 0} -x^2 = \lim_{x \to 0} x^2 = 0$ Hence  by the squeeze theorem, $\lim_{x \to 0} x^2 \cos \left( \frac{1}{x^2} \right) = f(0) = 0$. 

Suppose $f$ is absolutely continuous on $[-1,1]$. Hence it is of bounded-variation on $[-1,1]$, thus $V_f [0,1] < \infty$. Consider the partition with endpoints 
$$P = \{-1\} \cup \left[ \{ \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{n \pi}} : n \in \mathbb{N} \} \cap [-1,1] \right] \cup \{1\}$$
Hence for $x_i, x_{i+1} \in P$,
$$\sum^{\infty} _{n =1} |f(x_i) - f(x_{i+1})| = \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} \left|f \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n \pi}} \right) - f \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n+1)\pi}} \right) \right|$$
$$= \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} \left| \left[ \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n \pi}} \right)^2 \cdot \cos \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n+1) \pi}}^2} \right) \right] - \left[ \left( \sqrt{\frac{1}{(n+1) \pi}}\right)^2 \cdot \cos \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n+1) \pi}}^2}\right) \right]  \right|$$
$$= \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} \left| \left( \frac{1}{n \pi} \cos(n \pi) \right) - \left( \frac{1}{(n+1) \pi} \cos((n+1) \pi) \right) \right| = \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} \left| \frac{1}{n \pi} - \frac{-1}{(n+1) \pi} \right|$$
because $n$ is even and $n+1$ is odd. The above sum is equal to $\frac{1}{\pi} \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} \left| \frac{2n+1}{n^2 +n} \right|$ which diverges because it's a harmonic series. Thus $V_f[0,1] \nless \infty$. This is a contradiction to the assumption of $f$ being absolutely continuous, thus we have proven the desired result. QED



### Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ be a finite measure space. If $f$ is $\mu$-measurable and $p \leq f(x) \leq q$ for all $x \in X$, then prove that $\int_X f d \mu$ exists and $p \mu(X) \leq \int_X f d \mu \leq q \mu (X)$. 
#### My Solution:
Since $X$ is finite, and $p \leq f \leq q$, $\mu (X) = \int_X 1 d \mu$. This implies that $p \cdot \mu (X) \leq \int_X f d \mu \leq q \mu(X)$. 

Now, we must show that $\int_X f d \mu$ is integrable. Consider $|f| \leq \mathrm{max} \{|p|,|q|\} = M$. Hence $|f| \leq M$. This implies that $\int_X |f| d \mu \leq \mu (X) \cdot M < \infty$. Hence $f$ is integrable. QED



### Suppose that $1< q,p < \infty$ and that $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$. Prove that if $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ and $g_n \rightarrow g$ in $L^q(\mathbb{R})$, then $f_ng_n \rightarrow fg$ in $L^1(\mathbb{R})$. 
#### My Solution:
It is sufficient to show that the $\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_ng_n - fg||_1 = 0$. Well,
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_n g_n -fg||_1 = \lim_{n \to \infty}||f_ng_n - f_ng||_1 + ||f_ng -fg||_1$$
$$ \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_n||_p||g_n-g||_q + ||g||_q||f_n-f||_p$$
by Holder's Inequality where $\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_n||_p \rightarrow ||f||_p < \infty$. Thus $||g_n - g||_q \rightarrow 0$ and $||f_n - f||_p \rightarrow 0$. So the above limit does in fact imply that $f_ng_n \rightarrow fg$ in $L^1(\mathbb{R})$. QED

### If $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ and $p \geq 1$, then prove that $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$. 
#### My Solution:
Given $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$. This implies that $m = \mathrm{essup}(f) < \infty$ and $\int|f| < \infty$. So,
$$\int|f|^p = \int_{\{x:|f|<1\}} |f|^p + \int_{\{x: |f| >1\}}|f|^p$$
For $p>0$, $\int_{\{x:|f(x)<1\}}|f|^p < \int_{\{x:|f(x)<1\}}|f|$. Thus
$$\int_{\{x:|f|<1\}} |f|^p + \int_{\{x: |f| >1\}}|f|^p \leq \int_{\{x:|f|<1\}} |f| + \int_{\{x: |f| >1\}} m^p$$
where $\int_{\{x:|f|<1\}} |f| < \infty$ and $\int_{\{x: |f| >1\}} m^p = m^p \cdot m(\{x:|f(x) > 1\}) < \infty$ thus the entire equation is less than $\infty$. So $(\int|f|^p)^{1/p} < \infty$ for all $p$. Thus $f \in L^p$. QED



### If $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is measurable, then $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-n} ^n f = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f$. 
#### My Solution:
Since $f$ is positive, $f \cdot \chi_{[-n,n]}$ is a sequence of increasing positive functions. Thus 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f \cdot \chi_{[-n,n]} = \int \lim_{n \to \infty} f \cdot \chi_{[-n,n]} = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f$$ with the step of moving the limit inside the integral is by the Monotone Convergence Theorem. QED

### Show that every dense subset of $L^{\infty}([0,1])$ is uncountable.
#### My Solution:
Let $A = \{ \chi_{(0,t)} : t \in (0,1)\}$. Then for any $\chi_{(0,t_1)}, \chi_{(0,t_2)} \in A$ such that $t_1 \neq t_2$. So,
$$||\chi_{(0,t_1)} - \chi_{(0,t_2)}||_{\infty} = 1$$
Without loss of generality, $t_1 < t_2$, then $\chi_{(0,t_1)} - \chi_{(0,t_2)} = 0,1,0$ on $(0,t_1),(t_1,t_2),(t_2,1)$ respectively. This is where we get the above equality, as 
$$\left\|\chi_{(0,t_2)} - \chi_{(0,t_1)}\right\|_\infty = \sup_{x\in[0,1]}\left|\chi_{(0,t_2)}(x) - \chi_{(0,t_1)}(x)\right| = 1$$

Consider $\left\{ B_{\left(\chi_{(0,t)}, \frac{1}{3} \right)} \right\}$ which is an uncountable collection of disjoing balls. And given any dense set $S \subset L^{\infty}([0,1])$ has elements in each ball by definition of density. Thus $S$ is uncountable. QED



### Let $f$ be a Lebesgue measurable function on $\mathbb{R}$ with the property that $\sup_{\{g \in L^2(\mathbb{R}):||g||_2 \leq 1\}}\int_{\mathbb{R}}|fg|d \lambda \leq 1$. Prove that $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $||f||_2 \leq 1$.
#### My Solution:
For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let 
$$A_n = \{ x \in [-n,n]: |f(x)| \leq n\}$$
and let $f_n = f \chi_{A_n}$. Also define the linear functional $T_n:L^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$T_n(g) = \int_{\mathbb{R}}f_ng$$
Clearly $T_n$ is a bounded functional in $L^2$, since, by Holder's inequality,
$$|T_n(g)| \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}} |f_ng| \leq ||f_n||_2||g||_2$$
Since
$$|T_n(f_n)| = \left| \int_{\mathbb{R}} f^2 \chi_{A_n} \right| = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_n ^2 = ||f_n||_2 ^2$$
we can thus conclude that $||T_n|| = ||f_n||_2$. Moreover, $|f_ng|$ increases to $|fg|$ as $n \to \infty$. So
$$\sup_n |T_n(g)| \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}} |fg| < \infty$$
By the uniform boundedness principle, we can conclude that the sequence $(T_n)$ converges to a bounded linear functional $T$ and that
$$||T|| \leq \liminf_n ||T_n|| < \infty$$
On the other hand, by the monotone convergence theorem,
$$\liminf_n ||T_n|| = \liminf_n ||f_n||_2 = \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}} |f|^2 \right)^{1/2}$$
hence $f \in L^2$. Finally, taking $g = \frac{f}{||f||_2}$ in the assumption, we find that
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} |fg| = ||f||_2 \leq 1$$
Thus we have proven the desired result. QED



### Let $f \geq 0$ and $f \in L^p[0,1]$ for all $p \in [1, \infty)$. If $||f||_p ^p = ||f||_1$ for all $p \in [1, \infty)$, then there is a set $S$ such that $f = \chi_S$ a.e.
#### My Solution:
We know $||f||_1 = \int |f|^p$ for all $p \in [1, \infty)$. Suppose $m(\{x|f > 1\}) \neq 0$. Pick $\epsilon \in (1, \infty)$ such that $1 < \epsilon \leq f < \infty$. Then $$||f||_1 = \int|f|^p \geq \int_{\{1 < |f|\}} |f|^p \geq \int \epsilon ^p \rightarrow \infty$$
since $\epsilon > 1$. 

Cosider $m(\{x | 0 < f<1\})$, which we claim is equal to zero. To prove this, pick $0< |f| \leq \epsilon < 1$. Then 
$$||f||_1 = \int|f|^p \leq \int_{\{0 < |f| \leq \epsilon < 1\}} \epsilon^p \to 0$$ as $p \to \infty$. Hence $f = 0$ or $1$ almost everywhere. If we use this to define $S = \{x| f(x) =1\}$, then $f = \chi_S$ almost everywhere. QED



### If $E$ is a measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then there is an interval $I$ such that $m(E \cap I) > \frac{9}{10} m(I)$ or $m(E^c \cap I) > \frac{9}{10} m (I)$.
#### My Solution:
Suppose not! Then for all $I$, $m(E \cap I) \leq \frac{9}{10} \chi(I)$ and $m(E^c \cap I) \leq \frac{9}{10} \chi(I)$. Suppose $E$ has finite measure and let $E \subset \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} I_n$. Then
$$m(E) = m \left(E \cap \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} I_n \right) = m\left(\bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} E \cap I_n \right) \leq m(E \cap I_n) \leq \frac{9}{10} \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} m (I_n)$$
Thus for all covers of $E$, $m(E) \leq \frac{9}{10} \sum^{\infty} _{n =1} m(I_n)$. But, by definition 
$$m(E) = \inf \{m(I_n) : E \subset \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} I_n\}$$
Hence 
$$m(E) \leq \frac{9}{10} m(E) \implies m(E) = 0$$
Now for $E$ with any measure, 
$$m(E \cap(-n,n) \cap I_n) \leq m(E \cap I) \leq \frac{9}{n}m(I_n)$$
Hence $m(E \cap (-n,n)) = 0$ for all $n$ where 
$$m(E) = m \left(\bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} (E \cap(-n,n)) \right) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} m(E \cap (-n,n)) = 0$$
Note the same proof works for $m(E^c) = 0$. Thus the desired result is proven. QED



### A measure space $(X, \mu)$ is $\sigma$-finite iff there is an $f : X \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ such that $f \in L^1 (X, \mu)$. 
#### My Solution:
Assume that $f : X \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ such that $f \in L^1 (X, \mu)$. Then
$$X = \{f> 0\} = \bigcup^{\infty}_{n =1} \left\{f > \frac{1}{n} \right\}$$
where 
$$\mu \left(\left\{f > \frac{1}{n}\right\} \right) \leq \int \frac{|f|}{\frac{1}{(1/n)}}d \mu \leq n \cdot \int|f| < \infty$$
since $f \in L^1$ and by Chebyshev's Inequality.

Now assume $X$ is $\sigma$-finite. We have $X = \bigcup^{\infty}_{i = 1} A_n$, a union of disjoint sets wuth $\mu (A_n < \infty)$. Define $f = \sum^{\infty} _{n=1} a_n$ where $a_n = \frac{1}{\mu (A_n) \cdot n^2} \cdot \chi_{A_n}$ when $\mu(A_n) > 0$ and $a_n = \frac{1}{n^2} \chi_{A_n}$ when $\mu(A_n) = 0$. Then
$$\int f = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \int \frac{1}{\mu(A_n) \cdot n^2} \cdot \chi_{A_n} = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{\mu(A_n) \cdot n^2} \int \chi_{A_n} = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^2} < \infty$$
Thus proving the desired result. QED



### (a) Find a sequence $f_n: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\int_0 ^1 |f_n(x)| = 2$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = 1$ for all $x \in [0,1]$. (b) If the $f_n$ are as in part (a), then prove $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0 ^1 |f_n(x) -1| dx = 1$. 
#### My Solution:
(a)
$f_n(x):=4n^2x+1 \text{ for }x\in \left[0,\frac{1}{2n}\right]\\
f_n(x):=-4n^2x+1+4n \text{ for }x\in \left[\frac{1}{2n},\frac{1}{n}\right]\text{and }f(x)=1\text{ otherwise}.$

(b)
Given $f_n$ as defined above, we can simply integrate to get this answer. So, given $f_n$ defined as in part (a), $$f_n(x) -1 =4n^2x \text{ for }x\in \left[0,\frac{1}{2n}\right]\\
f_n(x)-1=-4n^2x+4n \text{ for }x\in \left[\frac{1}{2n},\frac{1}{n}\right]\text{and }f(x)=0\text{ otherwise}.$$
Thus 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0 ^1 |f_n -1| dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left[ \int_0 ^{1/2n} 4n^2x dx + \int_{1/2n} ^ {1/n} (-4n^2x+4n)dx \right]\\
= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left[ \frac{2n^2}{4n^2} -0 - \frac{2n^2}{n^2} + \frac{4n}{n} + \frac{2n^2}{4n^2} - \frac{4n}{2n} \right] = \lim_{n \to \infty} 1 = 1$$ QED




### Show that $\mathcal{G} = \{f \in C[0,1] : \int_0 ^1 f^2 > 1\}$ is open in $C[0,1]$. (Assume $C[0,1]$ has the uniform metric.)
#### My Solution:
The function $\phi(f) = \int_0 ^1 f^2$ is continuous. Thus $\phi ^{-1} ((1, \infty))$ must be open. QED



### Let $(X, \rho)$ be a metric space and suppose $K$ and $F$ are nonempty disjoint subsets of $X$ with $K$ compact and $F$ closed. (a) Prove there is a $\delta >0$ such that $\rho(x,y) \geq \delta$ for all $x \in K$ and $y \in F$. (b) Show that part (a) may fail if $K$ is closed, but not compact. 
#### My Solution:
***Not yest solved***



### The limit superior of a sequence of sets $\{E_k\}$ is defined as $\lim \sup E_k = \bigcap^{\infty}_{j=1} \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=j} E_k$. Let $\{E_k: k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{L}$. (a) Prove that if $\sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \lambda(E_k) < \infty$, then $\lambda(\lim \sup(E_k)) = 0$. (b) Is it true in general that $\lambda(\lim \sup(E_k)) = \lim \sup \lambda(E_k)$?
#### My Solution:
(a):
Let $\epsilon > 0$. Given $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} m(E_k) < \infty$, there exists $N$ such that $\sum^{\infty}_{k=N} m(E_k) < \epsilon$.
$$\lim \sup(E_k) = \bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=n} E_k \subset \bigcup^{\infty} _{k=N} E_k$$
Hence $$m(\lim \sup(E_k)) \leq m\left( \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=N} E_k \right) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{k=N} m(E_k) < \epsilon$$
which implies that $m(\lim \sup(E_k)) = 0$. QED

(b):
Consider the sequence of functions: $E_1 = [0,1], E_2 = [0,\frac{1}{2}], E_3 = [\frac{1}{2},1],E_4 = [0,\frac{1}{4}], E_5 = [\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}], E_6 = [\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4}], E_7 = [\frac{3}{4},1]$, and so on. Then $\lim_{n \to \infty} m(E_k) = 0$ but for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\bigcup^{\infty}_{k=n} E_k = [0,1]$. This implies that $\limsup(E_n) = [0,1]$. Thus it may not be true  that $\lambda(\lim \sup(E_k)) = \lim \sup \lambda(E_k)$. QED



### Show that $f(x) = x^2 \sin\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)$ where $x \neq 0$ and $f(x) = 0$ where $x = 0$ is in $BV[-1,1]$, but $g(x) = x^2 \sin \left( \frac{1}{x^2} \right)$ where $x \neq 0$ and $g(x) = 0$ where $x = 0$ is not.

# Important Notes
## Undergrad

For reference, these notes are gathered from the book *Real Analysis; A First Course* by Russell A. Gordon. These notes consist of basic real analysis ideas based off of my past undergraduate class taught by Dr. Christine Leverenz at Georgetown College.

### Gordon Chapter 1 (Real Numbers)

- A **field** is a nonempty set $F$ of objects that has two operations defined on it. These operations are usually defined as addition and multiplication. These operations follow a set of properties which will not be listed here as you should know them.

- **Triangle Inequality**: $|a+b| \leq |a|+|b|$. It follows from this that $||a|-|b|| \leq |a-b|$

- If $a \neq 0$ and $r \neq 1$ are real numbers, then 
$$a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+...+ar^n = a \cdot \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}$$

- **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**: Let $n$ be a positive integer. If $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ are real numbers, then
$$\left( \sum^n_{k=1} a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left(\sum^n_{k=1} a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum^n_{k=1} b_k^2 \right)$$
Equality occurs iff there is a constant $c$ such that $a_k = cb_k$ for all integers $k$

- The set $S$ is **bounded** if there is a number $M$ such that $|x| \leq M$ for all $x \in S$. The number $M$ is called a **bound** for S.

- Suppose that $S$ is bounded above. A number $\beta$ is the **supremum** of $S$ if $\beta$ is an upper bound of $S$ and any number less than $\beta$ is not an upper bound of $S$. We write $\beta = \sup (S)$

- Suppose that $S$ is bounded below. A number $\alpha$ is the **infimum** of $S$ if $\alpha$ is an lower bound of $S$ and any number greater than $\alpha$ is not an lower bound of $S$. We write $\alpha = \inf (S)$

- **Archimedean Property of the Real Numbers**: If $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers, then there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $na > b$.

- Between any two distinct real numbers, there exists a rational and an irrational number.

- A countable union of countable sets is countable. 

- Let $I$ be an interval and $f$ be a function such that $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$, and let $J$ be a subinterval of $I$. The function $f$ is **increasing** on $J$ if $f(x) \leq f(y)$ for all $x,y \in J$ such that $x<y$; and **strictly increasing** on $J$ if $f(x) < f(y)$ for all $x,y \in J$ such that $x < y$. The function $f$ is **decreasing** on $J$ if $f(x) \geq f(y)$ for all $x,y \in J$ that satisfy $x<y$; and **strictly decreasing** on $J$ if $f(x) > f(y)$ for all $x,y \in J$ such that $x<y$. The function $f$ is **monotone** on $J$ if it is either increasing or decreasing on $J$ and **strictly monotone** on $J$ if it is either strictly increasing or decreasing on $J$.


### Gordon Chapter 2 (Sequences)

- A **sequence** is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. A **sequence of real numbers** is a sequence whose codomain is the set $\mathbb{R}$. Although a sequence is a function, the standard notation for a sequence of real numbers is $\{x_n\}$ where the subscript $n$ denotes the **index** of the sequence.

- A sequence $\{x_n\}$ **converges to a number** $L$ if for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $|x_n - L| < \epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$. The sequence is **convergent** if there exists a number $L$ that the sequence converges to, otherwise it is **divergent**.

- The limit of a convergent sequence is unique.

- Suppose that $\{a_n\}$ converges to $a$ and $\{b_n\}$ converges to $b$. Then:

--- $\{ca_n\} \to ca$

--- $\{a_n \pm b_n\} \to a \pm b$

--- $\{a_n b_n\} \to ab$

- A monotone sequence converges iff it is bounded

- A sequence $\{x_n\}$ is a **Cauchy Sequence** if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $|x_m - x_n| < \epsilon$ for all $m,n \geq N$.

- A sequence of real numbers converges iff it is a Cauchy sequence

- Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence and let $\{p_n\}$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence $\{x_{p_n}\}$ is called a **subsequence** of $\{x_n\}$

- If a sequence $\{x_n\}$ converges to $L$, then every subsequence must converge to $L$ as well. 

- **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem**: Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. 


### Gordon Chapter 3 (Limits and Continuity)

- Let $I$ be an open interval that contains the point $c$ and suppose that $f$ is a function that is defined on $I$ except possibly at $c$. The function $f$ has **limit** $L$ at point $c$ if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x)-L| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in I$ such that $|x-c| < \delta$. We then write $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$.

- We have linearity for limits.

- Let $I$ be an interval and $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$, and let $c \in I$. The function $f$ is **continuous** at $c$ if for each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in I$ such that $|x-c| < \delta$. The function is continuous on $I$ if $f$ is continuous on every point of $I$.

- **Intermediate Value Theorem**: Suppose that $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. If $v$ is a number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there is a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = v$.

- **Extreme Value Theorem**: If $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then there exist points $c$ and $d$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(c) \leq f(x) \leq f(d)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.

- Let $I$ be an interval. A function $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ is **uniformly continuous** on $I$ if for each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(y) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $x,y \in I$ such that $|y-x| < \delta$.

- If $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$.

- A **partition** $P$ of an interval $[c,d]$ is a finite set of points $\{x_i|0 \leq i \leq n\}$ such that 
$$c=x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{n-1} < x_n = d$$

- Let $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function and let $[c,d]$ be any closed subinterval of $[a,b]$. The **variation** of $f$ on $[c,d]$ is defined by $V(f,[c,d]) = \sup \{\sum^n _{i=1}|f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})|\}$. Note that the integer $n$ is not fixed; the supremum is over all possible partitions of $[c,d]$. The function $f$ is of **bounded variation** on $[c,d]$ if $V(f,[c,d])$ is finite.


### Gordon Chapter 4 (Differentiation)

- Let $I$ be an interval, let $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$, and let $c \in I$. The function $f$ id **differentiable** at $c$ provided that the limit 
$$\lim_{v \to c} \frac{f(v) - f(c)}{v-c}$$ exists. The **derivative** of $f$ at $c$ is the value of the prementioned limit denoted by $f'(c)$.

- **Rolle's Theorem**: Let $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. If $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

- **Mean Value Theorem**: If $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that 
$$f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$


### Gordon Chapter 5 (Integration)

- A **tagged partition** $^t P$ of an interval $[a,b]$ consists of a partition $P = \{x_i | 0 \leq i \leq n\}$ of $[a,b]$ along with a set $\{t_i | 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ of points, known as **tags**, that satisfy $x_{i-1} \leq t_i \leq x_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$.

- Let $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $^t P = \{(t_i, [x_{i-1},x_i])|1 \leq i \leq n \}$ be a tagged partition of $[a,b]$. The **Riemann sum** $S(f, ^t P)$ of $f$ associated with $^t P$ is defined by 
$$S(f, ^t P) = \sum_{i=1} ^n f(t_i)(x_i - x_{i-1})$$

- A function $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is **Riemann integrable** on $[a,b]$ if there exists a number $L$ with the following property: for all $\epsilon >0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|S(f, ^t P) - L| < \epsilon$ for all tagged partitions $^t P$ of $[a,b]$ that satisfy $||^t P|| < \delta$. The number $L$ is called the **Riemann integral** of $f$ on $[a,b]$.

- **Cauchy Criterion for Riemann Integrability**: A bounded function $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ iff for each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|S(f,^t P_1)-S(f, ^t P_2)| < \epsilon$ for all tagged partitions $^t P_1$ and $^t P_2$ of $[a,b]$ with norms less than $\delta$.

- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a thing

- **Integration by Parts**: 
$$\int_a ^b f'g = f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) - \int_a ^b g'f$$


### Gordon Chapter 6 (Infinite Series)

- A **power series** is an expression of the form 
$$a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + ...$$
where the $a_k$'s are constants

- A **Fourier series** is an expression of the form
$$a_0 + a_1 \cos (x) + b_1 \sin (x) + a_2 \cos (2x) + b_2 \sin (2x) + ...$$
where the $a_k$'s and $b_k$'s are constants

- An **infinite series** of real numbers is an expression of the form
$$ \sum^{\infty} _{k=1} a_k = a_1 + a_2 + ...$$

- A **partial sum** of an infinite series is represented by $\sum_{k=1} ^n a_k$

- An infinite series **converges** if its corresponding sequence $\{s_n\}$ of partial sums converges. If $S$ is the limit of the previous sequence, then we say the series converges to $S$. If the sequence does not converge, we say that the series **diverges**.

- If the series $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} a_k$ converges, then the sequence $\{a_k\}$ converges to zero.

- The series $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} a_k$ converges iff for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $|\sum^n_{k=m+1} a_k| < \epsilon$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$ that satisfy $n > m \geq N$

- A series with nonnegative terms converges iff its sequence of partial sums is bounded

- Linearity is preserved

- **Geometric Series**: Suppose that $a \neq 0$. The geometric series $\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} ar^k$ converges if $|r| < 1$ and diverges if $|r| \geq 1$. If $|r| < 1$, 
$$\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} ar^k = \frac{a}{1-r}$$

- The $p$-series $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^p}$ converges if $p > 1$ and diverges if $p \leq 1$.

- Let $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} a_k$ be a series of real numbers. If ther series $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} |a_k|$ converges, then so does $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} a_k$.

- Rearrangement stuff is cool, but unnecessary for this study guide.


### Gordon Chapter 7 (Sequences and Series of Functions)

- Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of functions defined on an interval $I$ and let $f$ be a function defined on $I$. The sequence $\{f_n\}$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $I$ if the sequence $\{f_n(x)\}$ converges to $f(x)$ for each $x \in I$. In other words, $f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$ for all $x \in I$.

- Let $\{f_k\}$ be a sequence of functions defined on an interval $I$ and let $f$ be a function defined on $I$. The series $\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} f_k$ **converges pointwise** to $f$ on $I$ if the sequence $\{s_n\} = \{\sum^n_{k=1} f_k\}$ of partial sums converges pointwise to $f$ on $I$.

- Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of functions defined on an interval $I$ and let $f$ be a function defined on $I$. The sequence $\{f_n\}$ **converges uniformly** to $f$ on $I$ if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in I$ and for all $n \geq N$. 

- A lot more information is here, may add later. I just don't think it will help much for the Qual


### Gordon Chapter 8 (Point-Set Topology)

- A point $x$ is an **interior point** of $E$ if there exists a positive number $r$ such that $(x-r,x+r) \subseteq E$

- A point $x$ is an **isolated point** of $E$ if there exists a positive number $r$ such that $(x-r,x+r) \cap E = \{x\}$

- A point $x$ is a **limit point** of $E$ if for each positive number $r$, the set $(x-r,x+r) \cap E$ contains a point of $E$ other than $x$

- The set $E$ is **open** if all of its points are interior points

- The set $E$ is **closed** if it contains all of its limit points

- Every open interval is an open set and every closed interval is a closed set

- Let $E$ be a set of real numbers. A collection $\mathcal{G}$ of sets is an **open cover** of $E$ if each set in $\mathcal{G}$ is open and $E$ is contained in the union of all the sets in $\mathcal{G}$. The open cover $\mathcal{G}$ has a **finite subcover** if $E$ is contained in the union of a finite number of sets in $\mathcal{G}$

- A set $E$ is **compact** if every open cover of $E$ has a finite subcover

- A compact set is closed and bounded

- A closed subset of a compact set is compact

- A set of real numbers is compact iff it is closed and bounded

- More is in this section. Possibly going to add more, but I don't find it necessary for the Qual.









## Graduate Notes/Royden Book

### Royden Chapter 1 (Sets, Sequences, and Functions)
- A nonepmty set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **bounded above** provided that there is a real number $b$ such that $x \leq b$ for all $x \in E$. $b$ is known as an upper bound for $E$. We define bounded below similarly.

- **The Completeness Axiom**: Let $E$ be a nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above. Then among the set of upper bounds for $E$ there is a smallest, or least, upper bound.

- The least upper bound of $E$ is called the **supremum** of $E$ and denoted by $\mathrm{sup}E$. We define the **infimum** similarly as the greatest lower bound and denote it by $\mathrm{inf}E$.

- **Triangle Inequality**: 
$$|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$$

- A set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **inductive** provided it contains $1$ and if the number $x \in E$, the number $x+1 \in E$ as well.

- Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a smallest member.

- **Archimedean Property**: For each pair of positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, there is a natural number $n$ for which $na > b$.

- A set $E$ of real numbers is said to be **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ provided between any two real numbers there lies a member of $E$.

- The rational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

- A set $E$ is said to be **finite** provided either it is empty or there is a natural number $n$ such that $E$ is equipotent to $\{1,2,3,...,n\}$. 

- We say that $E$ is **countably infinite** provided $E$ is equipotent to the set $\mathbb{N}$ (the natural numbers). A set that is either finite or countably finite is said to be **countable**. A set that is not countable is **uncountable**.

- A subset of a countable set is countable.

- A nonempty set is countable iff it is the image of a function whose domain is a nonempty countable set.

- The union of countable sets is countable.

- A set $\mathcal{O}$ of real numbers is called **open** provided for each $x \in \mathcal{O}$, there is a $r > 0$ for which the interval $(x-r, x+r)$ is contained in $\mathcal{O}$.

- The set of real numbers and the empty set are open; the intersection of any finite collection of open sets is open; and the union of any collection of open sets is open.

- Every nonempty open set is the disjoint union of a countable collection of open intervals.

- For a set $E$ of real numbers, a real number $x$ is called a **point of closure** of $E$ provided every open interval that contains $x$ also contains a point in $E$. The collection of points of closure of $E$ is called the **closure** of $E$.

- A set of real numbers is open iff its complement in $\mathbb{R}$ is closed.

- A collection of sets $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ is said to be a **cover** of a set $E$ provided $E \subseteq \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}$. By a subcover of a cover of $E$ we mean a subcollection of the cover that itself also is a cover of $E$. If each set $E_{\lambda}$ in a cover is open, then we call $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ an **open cover** of $E$. If the cover $\{E_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ contains only a finite number of sets, we call it a **finite cover**. 

- Let $F$ be a closed and bounded set of real numbers. THen every open cover of $F$ has a finite subcover.

- We say that a countable collection of sets $\{E_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ is **descending** or **nested** provided that $E_{n+1} \subseteq E_n$ for every natural number $n$. It is said to be **ascending** provided $E_n \subseteq E_{n+1}$ for every natural number $n$.

- **$\sigma$-algebra**: Given a set $x$, a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra provided

-- the empty set belongs to $\mathcal{A}$

-- the complement in $X$ of a set in $\mathcal{A}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{A}$

-- the union of a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.

- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of subsets of a set $X$. Then the intersection $\mathcal{A}$ of all $\sigma$-algebras of subsets of $X$ that contain $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains $\mathcal{F}$. Moreover, it is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of subsets $X$ that contains $\mathcal{F}$ in the sense that any $\sigma$-algebra that contains $\mathcal{F}$ also contains $\mathcal{A}$.

- The collection $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets of real numbers is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of sets of real numbers that contains all of the open sets of real numbers. (every open set is a Borel set)


### Royden Chapter 2 (Lebesgue Measure)

- **The measure of an interval is its length**. Each nonempty interval $I$ is Lebesgue measurable and $$m(I) = l(I)$$

- **Measure is translation invariant**. If $E$ is Lebesgue measurable and $y$ is any number, then the translate of $E$ by $y$, $E+y = \{x+y|x \in E\}$, also is Lebesgue measurable and $$m(E+y) = m(E)$$

- **Measure is countably additive over countable disjoint unions of sets**. If $\{E_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is a countable disjoint collection of Lebesgue measurable sets, then 
$$m \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k \right) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k)$$

- The **outer measure** of an interval is its length, it is translation invariant, however the outer measure is not finitely additive. Instead:
$$m^* \left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_k \right) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m^*(E_k)$$

- Let $I$ be a nonempty interval of real numbers. For a set $A$ of real numbers, consider the countable collections $\{I_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ of nonempty open, bounded intervals that cover $A$, that is, collections for which $A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_k$. We define the **outer measure** of $A$, $m^*(A)$, to be
$$m^*(A) = \mathrm{inf}\{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}l(I_k) | A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_k\}$$

- A measure is **monotone** if for all $A \subseteq B$, then $m^*(A) \leq m^*(B)$.

- A set $E$ is said to be **measurable** provided for any set $A$ that
$$m^*(A) = m^*(A \cap E) + m^*(A \cap E^C)$$

- Any set of outer measure zero is measurable. In particular, any countable set is measurable.

- The union of a finite collection of measurable sets is measurable.

- The union of a countable collection of measurable sets is measurable.

- Every interval is measurable.

- The collection $\mathcal{M}$ of measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra that contains the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of Borel sets. Each interval, each open set, each closed set, and each clopen set is measurable.

- The translate of a measurable set is measurable.

- If $A$ is a measurable set of finite outer measure that is contained in $B$, then
$$m^*(B/A) = m^*(B) - m^*(A)$$ and $$m^*(B) = m^*(A) + m^*(B/A)$$ 

- The restriction of the set function outer measure to the class of measurable sets is called **Lebesgue Measure**. It is denoted by $m$, so that if $E$ is a measurable set, its Lebesgue measure will be $m(E)$, defined by
$$m(E) = m^*(E)$$

- The Lebesgue measure defined on the $\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets assigns length to any interval, is translation invariant, and is countably additive.

- **The Continuity of Measure**: Lebesgue measure possesses the following continuity properties:

(a) If $\{A_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is an ascending collection of measurable sets, then,
$$m \left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}A_k \right) = \lim_{k\to\infty} m(A_k)$$

(b) If $\{B_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ is a descending collection of measurable sets and $m(B_1) < \infty$, then $$m \left( \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}B_k \right) = \lim_{k\to\infty} m(B_k)$$

- For a measurable set $E$, we say that a property holds **almost everywhere** on $E$, or it holds for almost all $x \in E$, provided there is a subset $E_0$ of $E$ for which $m(E_0) = 0$ and the property holds for all $x \in E$ ~ $E_0$.

- Let $\{E_k\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ be a countable collection of measurable sets for which $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k) < \infty$. Then almost all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ belong to at most finitely many of the $E_k$'s.

- Let $E$ be a bounded measurable set of real numbers. Suppose there is a bounded, countably infinite set of real numbers $\Lambda$ for which the collection of translates of $E$, $\{\lambda + E\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$, is disjoint. Then $m(E) = 0$

- Any set $E$ of real numbers with positive outer measure contains a subset that fails to be measurable.

- There are disjoint sets of real numbers $A$ and $B$ for which
$$m^*(A \cup B) < m^* (A) + m^*(B)$$

- The Cantor set $C$ is a closed, uncountable set of measure zero

- The Cantor-Lebesgue function $\phi$ is an increasing continuous function that maps $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]$. Its derivative exists on the open set $\mathcal{O}$, the complement in $[0,1]$ of the Cantor set $\phi '=0$ on $\mathcal{O}$ while $m(\mathcal{O}) = 1$

- There is a measurable set, a subset of the Cantor set, that is not a Borel set.

### Royden Chapter 3 (Lebesgue Measurable Functions)

- Let the function $f$ have a measurable domain $E$. Then the following statements are equivalent:

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly in $L^p(E)$ to $f$. Then $\{f_n\}$ is bounded in $L^p(E)$ and $||f||_p \leq \mathrm{liminf}||f_n||_p$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set, $1 \leq p < \infty$, and $q$ the conjugate of $p$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly to $f$ in $L^p(E)$ and $\{g_n\}$ converges strongly to $g$ in $L^q(E)$. Then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E g_n \cdot f_n = \int_E g \cdot f$

- The **linear span** of a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of a linear space $X$ is the linear space consisting of all linear combinations of functions in $\mathcal{S}$, that is, the linear space of functions of the form $f = \sum^n _{k=1} \alpha_k \cdot f_k$ where each $\alpha_k$ is a real number and each $f_k$ belongs to $\mathcal{S}$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 \leq p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a bounded sequence in $L^p(E)$ and $f$ belongs to $L^p(E)$. Then $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly to $f$ in $L^p(E)$ iff for every measurable subset $A$ of $E$, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_A f_n = \int_A f$. If $p > 1$, it is sufficient to consider sets $A$ of finite measure.

- Let $[a,b]$ be a closed and bounded interval and $1 < p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a bounded sequence in $L^p[a,b]$ and $f$ belongs to $L^p[a,b]$. Then $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly to $f$ in $L^p[a,b]$ iff 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left[ \int_a ^x f_n\right] = \int^x _a f$$
for all $x \in [a,b]$. This theorem is false for $p =1$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 < p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly to $f$ in $L^p(E)$. Then $\{f_n\} \to f$ in $L^p(E)$ iff $\lim_{n \to \infty} ||f_n||_p = ||f||_p$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 < p < \infty$. Suppose $\{f_n\}$ converges weakly $f$ in $L^p(E)$. Then a subsequence of $\{f_n\}$ converges strongly in $L^p(E)$ to $f$ iff $||f||_p = \mathrm{liminf}||f_n||_p$

- Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1 < p < \infty$. Then every bounded sequence in $L^p(E)$ has a subsequence that converges weakly in $L^p(E)$ to a function in $L^p(E)$
